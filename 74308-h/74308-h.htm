<p>Though the events recorded in these letters are known
to all the world, they may, perhaps, take on another significance
seen through the eyes of one who has loved
Mexico for her beauty and wept for the disasters that
have overtaken her.</p>

<p>The time has not yet come for a full history of the
events leading to the breaking off of diplomatic relations,
but after much pondering I have decided to publish
these letters. They were written to my mother,
day by day, after a habit of long years, to console both
her and me for separation, and without any thought of
publication. In spite of necessary omissions they may
throw some light on the difficulties of the Mexican situation,
which we have made our own, and which every
American wishes to see solved in a way that will testify
to the persistence of those qualities that made us great.</p>

<p>Victoriano Huerta, the central figure of these letters,
is dead, and many with him; but the tragedy of the
nation still goes on. So above all thought of party or
personal expediency, and because of vital issues yet to
be decided, I offer this simple chronicle. The Mexican
book is still open, the pages just turned are crumpled
and ensanguined. New and momentous chapters for
us and for Mexico are being written and I should be
forever regretful had courage failed me to write my little
share.</p>

<p>It is two years ago to-day that diplomatic relations
were broken off between the two republics. It is more
than two years since the Constitutionalists under Villa
and Carranza have had our full moral and material
support. The results have been a punitive expedition
sent into Mexico to capture Villa, and very uncertain
and unsatisfactory relations with the hostile <i lang="la">de facto</i>
government under Carranza. As for beautiful Mexico—her
industries are dead, her lands laid waste, her sons
and daughters are in exile, or starving in the “treasure-house
of the world.” What I here give forth—and the
giving is not easy—I offer only with a trembling hope
of service.</p>

departed the same evening for the heights in the presidential
car, put at N.’s disposal the night before, for the trip
from Mexico City and back.</p>

<p>It was a long day. Everybody was up at dawn, walking
about the deck or hanging over the sides of the ship,
all a bit restless at the thought of the Mexican uncertainties
which we were so soon to share. About six
o’clock we began to distinguish the spires of Vera Cruz—the
peak of Orizaba, rivaling the loveliest pictures of
Fujiyama, showing its opal head above a bank of dark,
sultry clouds. A hot, gray sea was breaking over the
reefs at the mouth of the harbor, and the same lonely
palms stood on the Isla de los Sacrificios. As we passed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
between the two gray battle-ships just outside the harbor,
I could not help a little shudder at the note of warning
they struck. The dock was crowded with the well-remembered,
picturesque, white-clad Indians, with high-peaked
hats, who suggested immediately the changeless
mystery of Mexico.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the weather being overcast, the intense
heat was a little modified, though it was no day to set
off looks or clothes; every one’s face and garments were
gray and limp. N. arrived just as we were getting up
to the docks, his train having been late. His face was
the last we discovered among various officials coming and
going during the irksome pulling in of the <i lang="es">Espagne</i>.
As you know, we had been separated for eight months.
I was the first passenger to leave the ship, and as we
had no customs formalities we passed quickly through
the damp, boiler-like shed where the little tricks of the
<i lang="es">aduana</i> (the customs) were about to be performed
on hot and excited voyagers. Then we got into a rickety
cab, its back flap flying to the breeze, and drove across
the sandy, scrubby stretch to the Hotel Terminus,
where the Linds are living. The fascinating little pink
houses with their coquettish green balconies were as of
yore, but the tropical glint and glitter seemed gone from
everything under the hot, gray sky.</p>

<p>The Hotel Terminus is the same old horror of flies,
fleas, and general shiftlessness, though the broad, high
corridor up-stairs, giving on to the sleeping-rooms, was
fairly clean. We were finally shown into a large room,
where Mrs. Lind was waiting. After our greetings I
sank into a rocking-chair, and a big electric fan, in conjunction
with the breeze from the window looking toward
the sea, somewhat restored my energy.</p>

<p>In a few minutes Mr. Lind appeared, in shirt-sleeves
and a panama fan. (I suppose he wore other articles,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
but these are what I remember.) I was greatly struck
by him. He is evidently a man of many natural abilities
and much magnetism—tall, gaunt, sandy-haired, unmistakably
Scandinavian, with the blue, blue eyes of the
Norsemen set under level brows. I imagine fire behind
that northern façade. The conversation opened with
conciliatory and smiling remarks, after the manner of
experts in any situation, meeting for the first time. I
found him very agreeable. There was even something
Lincolnesque in his look and bearing, but his entry on
the Mexican stage was certainly abrupt, and the setting
completely unfamiliar, so some very natural barking of
the shins has been the result. Looking at him, I couldn’t
help thinking of “the pouring of new wine into old
bottles” and all the rest of the scriptural text.</p>

<p>The Linds, who have a handsome house in Minneapolis
and another “on the lake,” are accepting things as
they find them, with an air of “all for the good of the
United States and the chastising of Mexico.” But all the
same, it is a hardship to inhabit the Terminus and then
to tramp three times a day through the broiling streets
to another hotel for very questionable food.</p>

<p>The Hotel Diligencias, where we lunched, is deeper
in the town, has fewer flies, is a little cleaner, and is very
much hotter. Once away from the sea breeze you might
as well be in Hades as in Vera Cruz on a day like yesterday.
The Diligencias is the hotel whereon De Chambrun
hangs the famous story of his wife’s maid going
back for something that had been forgotten, and finding
that the servants had whisked the sheets off the beds
and were ironing them out on the floor for the next comers—<i lang="es">sans
autre forme de procès</i>! We had a pleasant
lunch, with the familiar menu of <i lang="es">Huachinango</i>, <i lang="es">pollo
y arroz</i>, alligator pears and tepid ice-cream, consumed
to the accompaniment of suppositions regarding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
Mexican politics. Then we plunged into the deserted,
burning street (all decent folk were at the business of the
siesta) and back to the Hotel Terminus, feeling much the
worse for wear.</p>

<p>At four o’clock Lieutenant Courts came to conduct
us to the flag-ship <em>Louisiana</em>, and we asked Hohler, the
British <i lang="fr">chargé</i> who was in Vera Cruz awaiting the arrival
of Sir Lionel and Lady Carden, to go with us.
Admiral Fletcher and his officers were waiting for Nelson
at the gangway and the band was playing <em>the</em> beloved
air as we went up. We were there about an hour, which
seemed all too short, sitting on the spotless deck, where
a delightful breeze was blowing. The time passed in
eager conversation about the situation with Admiral
Fletcher, a charming and clever man, with dark, earnest
eyes and serious, intent expression, all set off by the
most immaculate white attire. Champagne was poured,
healths were drunk, and Elim was taken over the ship,
departing with one of the junior officers, after a glance
at me betokening the magnitude of the adventure.
We left, after warm handshakings and good wishes, N.
receiving his eleven salutes as we went away. The tears
came to my eyes. “Oh, land of mine!” I thought. “Oh,
brotherhood!” But Elim asked, in a frightened tone,
“Why are they shooting at papa?”</p>

<p>We then went over to the <em>New Hampshire</em> to call on
Captain Oliver. More health-drinking and stirring of
friendly feelings. Pictures of the Holy Father and prelates
I have known gave a familiar note to Captain Oliver’s
quarters. Then, in the wondrous tropical dusk, the
little launch steamed quickly back to town, where we
had just time to gather up our belongings and maid at
the Terminus and descend to the station beneath. Mr.
Lind stood waving farewell as we steamed out, and I
must say I am quite taken by him!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span></p>

<p>Our train, preceded by a military train, was most
luxurious. None of “the comforts of home” was lacking,
from the full American bill of fare to the white-coated
colored porters—all at poor, bankrupt Huerta’s
expense. It made me eat abstemiously and sit lightly!</p>

<p>We had a quiet night, rising swiftly up those enchanting
slopes, a warm, perfumed, exotic air coming in at
the window. At dawn, with a catching of the breath,
I looked out and saw once again those two matchless,
rose-colored peaks—Popocatepetl and Iztaccihuatl, looking
tranquilly down on the beauteous plateau, indifferent
to man’s disorders.</p>

<p>At Mexico City Captain Burnside and the Embassy
staff were at the station to meet us, and in a moment
I found myself once again driving through the familiar,
vivid streets, the changeless, silent Indians coming and
going about their simple affairs. The Embassy is a
huge house—a gray-stone, battlemented, castle-on-the-Rhine
effect—which, fortunately, had been put on a
possible living basis for the Linds by a kindly administration.
It’s an ill wind that blows nobody good.
The Linds were here only ten days, and I think it very
improbable that they will ever return. He is a man of
good sense, and there is, as in most establishments,
room for many men but only for one <i lang="fr">maîtresse de
maison</i>.</p>

<p>Now I must be up and doing. I want to pull the furniture
about, down-stairs, and make myself a setting of
some sort. There are several packing-boxes containing
the accumulation of our first Mexican bout—books,
vases, cushions, and the like. Fortunately, the comfortable
green leather library set of Mr. Henry Lane Wilson,
together with handsome rugs and bookcases, were also
bought for the “confidential agent”; and I shall use
them in my drawing-room, instead of a rather uncomfortable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
French set upholstered in pink. The bedrooms
are already fully and handsomely furnished with
the Wilsons’ things.</p>

<p>Dear Mme. Lefaivre came last night, and we had
lunch at the Legation to-day. Such an affectionate
welcome from her warmest of hearts! Many persons
have called and cards and flowers were coming in all
day.</p>

<p><i lang="la">P. S.</i> Yesterday, Torreon fell into the hands of the
rebels, and many atrocities were committed against
Spanish subjects. The Spanish minister is in a great
state of excitement. This is a severe blow to Huerta.
He is supposed to suppress the revolution. If he doesn’t,
he loses his <i lang="fr">raison d’être</i>—perhaps, also, his head.</p>

<h3><em>October 11th.</em></h3>

<p>Last night Huerta accomplished his second <i lang="fr">coup d’état</i>;
he is getting very skilful. He surrounded the Chamber
of Deputies while the honorable gentlemen were in session,
conspiring against their constitution. He had them
arrested as they came out into the hall, and I understand
there was quite a stampede from the Chamber itself
when they got wind of the fact that something was
wrong. He accuses them of obstructing his policy of
pacification by every low and unpatriotic means at their
command, and these are numerous.</p>

<p>Now one hundred and ten of them are lodged in the
famous <i lang="es">Penitenciaría</i>, whither Madero was going on his
last journey. N. was out until two o’clock in the morning,
with the Spanish minister (dean of the diplomatic
corps), going first to the Foreign Office to try to obtain
guarantees for the lives of the imprisoned Deputies, and
afterward to the <i lang="es">Penitenciaría</i>, where they were shown
a list of <em>eighty-four</em>, and given assurances that they would
not suffer. It looked a bit black for the remaining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
twenty-six. The clerks spent the rest of the night here,
getting the despatches off to Washington.</p>

<p>Huerta appears to care very little whom he shoots.
He has small sentiment about human life (his own, or
anybody’s else), but he is a strong and astute man; and
if he could get a few white blackbirds, in the shape of
patriots, to work with him, and if the United States were
not on his back, he might eventually bring peace to his
country.</p>

<p>I am not yet reaccustomed to the extreme beauty of
the Mexican morning; a dazzling, many-colored light
that would dim the spectrum is filtering into my room,
as I write, glorifying every object and corner. I have
had the covers taken off the pink furniture; a rose-colored
coverlet and cushions are on my <i lang="fr">chaise-longue</i>,
and the <em>glow</em> is indescribable.</p>

<p>You will have seen that the Chambers are convened
for the fifteenth of November, but in spite of preparations
for legislation, a warlike something is in the air.
Squads of soldiers are passing the Embassy, with much
playing of the beautiful national hymn. They handle
their brass very well, and their military music would be
good anywhere.</p>

<p>In Washington they are taking the news of the <i lang="fr">coup
d’état</i> with their coffee....</p>

<p>I have not yet seen von Hintze,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> though he came early
yesterday, bringing a gift of fortifying liqueur, “for the
altitude,” and some flowers; and I went with Elim to
the Legation, later on. I understand that he looks at
the situation rather <i lang="fr">en noir</i>. But he is somewhat of a
bear on Mexican matters, anyway, his first experience,
on arriving three years ago, being the horrid Covadonga
murders.... A certain natural exclusiveness and
aloofness are among his special attributes, and his psychology<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
is somewhat mysterious, even to his friends;
but he is immensely clever and charming, of the world,
and very sympathetic—really a <i lang="fr">cher</i> colleague!</p>

<p>N. has just left the house in frock-coat and top-hat,
the chiefs of mission having been summoned to the
Foreign Office, where they will hear the official reason of
the <i lang="fr">coup d’état</i>. I shall be most interested in the explanation,
which will probably be some adroit Latin-American
arrangement of facts. One has a feeling of being at
school, here, and constantly learning something new to
the Anglo-Saxon mentality.</p>

<p>Now I must hie me down-stairs and tackle a few of
<em>my</em> “affairs of the interior.” The house is so big that,
even with the many servants now in it, it doesn’t seem
“manned,” and bells are answered very intermittently.
One or more of the servants can always be found at the
gates of the garden, greeting the passers-by—a little
Indian habit, and incurable. What I need is a European
<i lang="fr">maître d’hôtel</i> to thunder at them from his Aryan heights
as the Wilsons had. There are some good Aztec specimens
left over from their administration, whom I shall
keep on—Aurora, a big, very handsome Indian maid,
from the Apam valley; Maria, the head washerwoman,
with fine, delicate hands, like a queen; and a few others.
Neither cook nor butler. Berthe is busy unpacking and
pressing; everything was wrinkled by the damp, penetrating
heat of the sea-trip.</p>

<p>The Embassy has two <i lang="es">gendarmes</i> to watch the gate,
instead of the usual one given to legations—nice, old
Francisco, who has been in the service of the United
States for twelve years, and a handsome new one—Manuel.
The auto stands before the gate all day long.
Jesus, the chauffeur, seems very good—a fine-featured,
lithe-bodied, quick-witted young Indian. Though married,
he is, I hear, much sought after by the other sex.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
Elim always goes out with me, and loves sitting on the
front seat with his dog, a melancholy Irish terrier sent
by Mr. Armstead from Guanajuato.</p>

<p>Exchange is now very low. One hundred dollars equals
two hundred and eighty Mexican dollars. Very nice for
those supplied from abroad, but killing to these people,
and with the sure prospect of getting worse. The price
of articles has gone up by leaps and bounds—not native
foods so much, but all articles of import. I hear the
auto-horn and must stop. Will be very much interested
to hear the official wherefor of the <i lang="fr">coup d’état</i>.</p>


<h3><em>October 12th, Evening.</em></h3>

<p>Well, the Diplomatic Corps, in uniform, was received
at the Foreign Office with much unction, by the large,
stout Moheno, Minister of Foreign Affairs, of whom
more another time. He insisted principally on the
great efforts General Huerta was making to restore
peace, and the equally great obstructions placed in
his way, saying that since the opening of Congress
these obstructions had been particularly in evidence,
handicapping him at every step. He added that,
though the act of dissolving Congress was unconstitutional,
Mexico must be compared to an ill man
needing an immediate operation; and that the government
was confronted by the dilemma formulated
by Gambetta (they do love to find a European simile
for their situation)—“Yield or resign!” which, in this
case, would have been tantamount to national dissolution.
The crux of the speech is, however, that the
elections are to be held this month.</p>

<p>Sir Lionel presented his letters of credence yesterday,
thus putting the hall-mark of his government upon
Huerta. It appears there was quite a love-feast; Huerta,
of course, was immensely pleased at the proof of recognition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
at the delicate moment of his birth and first
struggling cry as a dictator.</p>

<p>Since the imprisonment of the Deputies there has been
a constant stream of their mothers and wives and daughters
coming to the Embassy for help, though, of course,
we can do nothing; little, plain, black-dressed, black-eyed
women or high-chested, thick-lipped, diamond-ear-ringed
ones, inclining to magenta or old gold; mostly,
as far as I can see, Maderista in their tendencies. Two
of the little, plain, black type who were here late last
night, said they went every day to visit Madero’s grave!
They fear the Deputies will be shot, but I hardly
think shrewd old Huerta will go to any unnecessary
lengths with the very cold eye of the world upon him.
Keeping them locked up, where they can’t vote, or disqualifying
them, is all that he wants. It is true that they
have never missed an opportunity in the Chamber to
put a spoke in his wheel, and he got bored with the
continual “block.” He didn’t arrest members of the
Catholic party who, for the most part, had been trying
to sustain order through him; they are, after all is said
and done, the conservative, peace-wishing element in
Mexico.</p>

<p>The Senate he simply dissolved. They have not been
giving him so much trouble. One of the heads of the
Catholic party came to see N. yesterday, to talk over the
opportuneness of their putting up any one as candidate
for President—a tentative conversation, on his part.
Men of his class, unfortunately for Mexico, rarely identify
themselves with political life, and were entirely invisible
during the Madero régime. The Clerical party
has very little money, and feels the battle unequal and
the outcome most uncertain. N. was, of course, non-committal
in the matter, which he said was not in his
province; but he added that there was no reason for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
the party to neglect to make some kind of representation,
any more than for the others to do so. Huerta
is, of course, thoroughly anti-Clerical.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the first anniversary of the independence
of China; it may be because it is so far away, but
they seem to have had <em>their</em> revolution with very little
sound of breakage. There was a reception at the Chinese
Legation during the generous hours of 4 to 10. I
went at about 5. I got up to go four times, and each
time the <i lang="fr">chargé d’affaires</i> caught me at the door and said,
“You have been absent eight years—no, I mean eight
months—and I can’t let you go.” I finally ran the
blockade at 7.30, promising some insistent Oriental near
the outer door that I would return. All the diplomats
were there. I found von Hintze, like a visitant from
another world, sitting, inscrutable, by the handsome,
buxom wife of the Guatemalan minister. She was in
black lace over orange silk, making my white tailor suit
seem very severe. Stalewski, the Russian minister, was
standing near, waiting for his tea. Sir L. and Lady C.
came in at 6 o’clock only, then Madame Lefaivre—the
Occidental diplomats naturally gravitating toward one
another. Finally, at 7, when the rooms down-stairs
were packed like sardine-boxes, we were directed up-stairs,
where a handsome “champagne lunch” was
served. It was after this that I made my escape. The
wife of the <i lang="fr">chargé</i>, and some other Oriental ladies, in
appalling Western costumes, stood in close formation
near the door from start to finish, wearing an unfading
Oriental smile.</p>

<p>N. spent the afternoon hunting for the Dictator,
having been unable to track him down since the famous
<i lang="fr">coup</i>. He hopes to induce him to clemency regarding
the Deputies. Huerta has a very effective way of dropping
out of a situation—just subtracting himself and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
reappearing when events have moved on. He preserves,
according to his edict of the 11th, the full powers vested
in the executive, adding generously the powers of Gobernación
(Interior), Hacienda (Treasury), and War, though
only for the time absolutely necessary for the re-establishment
of the legislative power. By the powers of
Gobernación he has declared invalid the exemption of
Deputies from arrest and makes them subject to the
jurisdiction of the tribunals if found guilty of any offense
or crime; most of the Deputies are only getting what
they deserve. There is certainly reason to complain of
their lack of public spirit; there seems little or no available
material here from which to build a self-governing
state, and a dictator (or intervention) is what they need.
Juarez took the fear of hell away from them some fifty
years ago; Madero took the respect for the <i lang="es">supremo
gobierno</i> (supreme power) as typified by the strong hand
of Diaz. There seems nothing left to hold them—those
fifteen millions, with their sixty-three dialects and their
thousand idiosyncrasies of race and climate.</p>

<p>Huerta has a handsome, quiet-faced wife and eleven
children. These and a rented house (he has never lived
at Chapultepec or at the Palace) are, up to now, his
only apparent worldly possessions. I doubt whether he
has the inclination or takes the time for an undue amount
of grafting. He is, from what I hear, very canny in the
matter of human equations and seems full of vitality
and a sort of tireless, Indian perseverance. They
say that the more he drinks the clearer his brain
becomes.</p>

<p>Nine Spaniards that were killed in Torreon the other
day, on refusing to give up their goods and money,
had their execution preceded by such gentle rites as
digging their own graves. Villa has declared no quarter
to Spaniards; they must get out of <em>his</em> Mexico, bag and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
baggage, and he intends to see that the Church leaves
with them.</p>

<p>On all sides are praises of N.’s handling of the many
complicated questions coming up, and his being <i lang="la">persona
grata</i> with all parties. It is known that though in the
carrying out of difficult orders from Washington there is
an absolute point-blankness, in their own affairs the
Mexicans can count on tact, courtesy, and any service
compatible with his position.</p>

<p>I imagine that Mr. Lind will soon be realizing the futility
of an indefinite stay on Mexican soil. There are
no results—and I rate him a man used to results.</p>

<h3><em>October 13th.</em></h3>

<p class="dropcap">Manuel Bonilla, a former Maderista, Minister
of Ways and Communications (known sometimes as
“Highways and Buyways”), now Senator from Sinaloa,
has just come, begging asylum. They are out to kill him.
He greatly resembles the people who are after him. Of
course we have had a room made ready for him, and he
can stay quietly in it until a chance offers for getting
out of the country. His room, by the way, contains the
bed that Mrs. —— refused when she was shown over
the Embassy, saying, “What! Sleep in the bed of a
murderess?” The murderess being dear, gentle, pretty
Mrs. Wilson, my late <i lang="fr">chefesse</i>, and the murdered ones, I
<em>suppose</em>, being Madero and Pino Suarez!</p>

<p>President Wilson has now sent a message to the provisional
government, entirely disapproving of the act
of dissolving Congress, saying that any violence offered
any Deputy will be looked on as an offense against the
United States, and that, furthermore, the United States
will not recognize any President elected after any such
proceedings. N. has just gone to the Foreign Office to
deliver himself of the news. Moheno is a large, stout,
curly-haired Indian from Chiapas, with a bit of something
dark thrown in. He suggests a general effect of
Italian tenor, but he is clever—perhaps “cute” is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
better word. These unfortunate people are between
the devil and the deep sea—<i lang="la">i. e.</i>, between their own lawlessness
and us.</p>

<p>The Cardens had their first reception to-day. The
Legation is a new, artistic, most comfortable house just
off the Paseo—the sort of thing English diplomats find
awaiting them everywhere. Sir L. was here for sixteen
years as consul. He was the British government’s
first representative after the Maximilian affair; so,
though he has been absent many years, he finds himself
<i lang="fr">en pays de connaissance</i>. He is the handsome, perfectly
groomed, tall, fresh-complexioned, white-mustached,
unmistakable Briton. She is an agreeable American
woman; but they both look pale and bloodless after
many years of Habana and Guatemala. We are none
of us at our rosiest under the palm and cactus. Sir L.
has had thirty years of Latin-American diplomatic
experience.</p>


<h3><em>October 14th.</em></h3>

<p>Proofs multiply of direct conspiracy of the Deputies
against the provisional government. If you scratch
a Maderista Deputy you are sure to find a revolutionary
of some sort. The task of establishing peace seems well-nigh
hopeless. Everywhere are treachery and venality.
The note N. handed yesterday to the Foreign Office has
not yet been answered, though Moheno refers to it in a
press interview, saying that it had been presented to him
by <i lang="fr">Chargé d’affaires</i> O’Shaughnessy, “A gentleman of
the most exquisite culture,” and that he must not be
held responsible for the “intemperate language of his
government,”—rather cocky! Though N. is handling
the officials with all possible care, everybody thinks they
are preparing a fiery answer for to-morrow. They are
capable, at any moment, of sending an ultimatum to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
Washington themselves, and then the fat would be in
the fire!</p>

<p>A heavenly warm sun is streaming in. These October
mornings, after the rains have ceased, are the brightest
jewels in Mexico’s crown of loveliness.</p>

<p>N. is so sick of the murder and destruction he sees at
first hand that he refuses to read anything about Mexico.
He is, in fact, living a book of his own. But I take
an interest in outside comment. I have just read an
article in the <cite>North American Review</cite>, by Sydney Brooks,
giving the English view of the situation, which seems to
be that if we had recognized Huerta he would, by now,
have been far on the road toward the establishment of
peace. Also a quotation from <cite>Le Temps</cite>, in to-day’s <cite>Imparcial</cite>,
to the same effect. N., however, is beginning to
think that nothing but intervention can bring about
order. The elements of peace seem no longer in the
republic itself. Intervention <em>is</em> a big word, but it
needn’t mean the extermination of Americans or their
interests in Mexico. Many French people stayed on
through the French intervention and reached a green old
age; Americans could do the same. Any one who really
knows how easily peace is frightened out of a Latin-American
republic, and how wary she is about coming
back, would think twice about alarming her.</p>

<p>Elim has just presented me with a large bunch of pink
geraniums from the vases at our front entrance. I wish
he would choose a more remote spot for depredations.
He is drawn, as if by a magnet, to the <i lang="fr">gendarmes</i> and
the untasted joys of the pavement. The Mexicans are
always nice with children. There isn’t as much difference
between the little ones and the grown-ups as in
more sophisticated countries.</p>

<p>Bonilla, our minister-in-hiding, keeps very quiet.
From what I hear, just to feel safe appears to be a great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
luxury. I have had no intercourse with him, beyond an
exchange of polite messages and putting one of the men-servants
at his disposition. They tell me he is very particular
about keeping his windows shut and his blinds
well drawn at night, and is a bit jumpy if any one knocks
at the door.</p>

<p>Huerta has very little natural regard for human life.
This isn’t a specialty of successful dictators, anyway.
Only by the hand of iron can this passionate, tenacious,
mysterious, gifted, undisciplined race, composed of countless
unlike elements, be held in order. In the States,
where, of course, as we all know, everybody and everything
are just as they ought to be, this isn’t quite understood.</p>


<h3><em>October 14th.</em></h3>

<p>There is a very persistent rumor to-night that the
answer to President Wilson’s message delivered by N.
yesterday will be met by Mexico with the breaking off of
diplomatic relations, in which case we will have to clear
out immediately for Vera Cruz. The private citizens in
town can take their time in leaving; <em>we</em> must go quickly.
I am not even unpacked; the linen of the voyage still
hangs on the roof. It all quite takes my breath away; I
scarcely feel as if I had returned, and can’t take in the
idea of leaving. The full cup from the lip. We shall
be a nine days’ wonder on reaching New York, and then
what? The American diplomatic service is the most
uncertain quantity in the world.</p>


<h3><em>Later.</em></h3>

<p>Much expectant coming and going in the house, as I
write. N., who is admirable at soothing these people,
has seen Moheno, and, after long argument, has persuaded
the Foreign Office to modify the belligerent tone
of the answer to Washington. There were three Cabinet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
meetings held since last night, to discuss the answer,
with a majority in favor of extreme measures. It is,
however, only putting off the day of rupture a few weeks
or months, though N. feels each victory is so much
gained for the United States. But the day will come
when we will find ourselves trekking north.</p>


<h3><em>October 16th.</em></h3>

<p>Yesterday, at dark, we got Bonilla off, grateful but
nervous. The motor took him to a station about twenty
kilometers from the town, where he boarded the train
for Vera Cruz, to get the German boat of to-day. Along
a certain trend of legal reasoning he is some sixth in line
for President, after Madero, Pino Suarez, Lascurain, and
others who have been killed, or have disappeared from
the uncertain glories of office. He goes to Washington
to join the Maderistas, I <em>suppose</em>, in spite of the fact that
he has given his word of honor not to ally himself with
the revolutionists. It was only on such a promise
that we could give asylum to an enemy of the government
to which N. is accredited.</p>

<p>The legal (if not the moral) genealogical tree of
Huerta’s Presidency is the following: Madero, Constitutional
President; Pino Suarez, Constitutional Vice-President
(their resignations were accepted previous to
their imprisonment, by Pedro Lascurain, Minister for
Foreign Affairs, and a God-fearing, honorable gentleman,
by the way); Lascurain became President by
operation of law in regard to the vacant executive power;
he was President some twenty minutes it appears (a
bit short, even for Latin-America), giving him time to
appoint Huerta to the post of Minister of Gobernación
(Interior). After Lascurain’s resignation, given, I understand,
with alacrity, automatically, by operation of
law, the executive power fell to Huerta with its provisional<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
character, and under the Constitutional promise
to call especial elections. This is the technical way by
which Huerta became President, and, according to the
Mexican constitution, there are no doubts about the
complete legality of the operation.</p>


<h3><em>October 17th.</em></h3>

<p>A quiet day; many rumors, but no events. All the
time the Carranzistas are gathering strength as a party;
strength apparently coming to them from “above”—a
higher <em>latitude</em>, I mean. Seen at close range they are,
unfortunately, no better than “the others.” Carranza
is not a bloodthirsty villain, but the physically timid,
greedy, quiet, conscienceless, book-reading kind, and
“constitucionalista” is a word to conjure with. It
can move a good Anglo-Saxon to tears, though I must
say that all revolutionary leaders in Mexico get hold of
excellent banner devices. Madero’s were above criticism—“<i lang="es">Sufragio
efectivo y no Re-elección</i>” (“Effective
Suffrage and No Re-election”). This last shows you
that they can go much farther in the expression of pure,
distilled patriotism and democracy than we, as those of
us called to the dignity of office are not entirely able to
rid ourselves of a wish for a second term.</p>

<p>Also Carranza, who has none of the ability of Huerta
and none of his force, has had the luck to strike a convincing
note with his long whiskers and generally venerable
aspect, imitated by all his followers as far as
nature allows. They tell me New York and Washington
are full of respectable, thin, long-whiskered, elderly
Mexicans. Those who have watched Carranza’s long
career, however, say that a quiet, tireless, sleepless
greed has been his motive force through life, and his
strange lack of friendliness to Washington is accounted
for by the fact that he really hates foreigners, any and
all, who prosper in Mexico. It seems to me one can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
scent trouble here. Lack of any special political color
and principles, and general mediocrity, have kept him
obscure, but he now finds himself at last accidentally
clothed and most acceptable to the <i lang="es">Gran Nación del
Norte</i> in the fashionable and exclusive garb of constitutionalism.
I wonder if he doesn’t sometimes wonder
why on earth he is so popular in Washington.</p>

<p>I am told that Señora Madero, poor, pitiful, little,
black-robed figure, saw President Wilson soon after the
murders, and her tragic tale may perhaps have determined
his policy.</p>

<p>The fact remains, however, that Huerta is in control
of the army and the visible machinery of government
which represents to the conservative elements (badly
enough or well is a detail), their constitution, the only
form around which the affairs of the nation can group
themselves with any definiteness.</p>

<p>I had a long talk the other day with the —— minister.</p>

<p>He seems to think (all, of course, politely veiled) that
the policy of the United States is to weaken these people
by non-recognition, and, when they are agonizing, to
come in cheaply and easily, thus avoiding armed intervention
now, which would be much better for the Mexicans,
though more expensive for us. All the <i lang="fr">chers collègues</i>
veil behind unassailably discreet remarks their
not very flattering idea of what they doubtless call among
themselves our “little game.”</p>

<p>I am enjoying the spaces in this huge house, free to the
sun and air on all sides. Its lack of furniture is amply
compensated for by flooding luxuries of light and air.
I am going to receive on Tuesday, and I suppose many
people will come.</p>


<h3><em>October 22nd.</em></h3>

<p>Yesterday I had my first reception. About fifty people
came—the <i lang="fr">chers collègues</i> and some of the colony,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
mostly only those whose orbit sometimes crosses the diplomatic
orbit. There were flowers in every available
receptacle. I made a delicious punch myself, if I do
say it, and Mrs. Burnside poured tea; but I miss so
many of the familiar and friendly faces of our first sojourn—Mr.
James Brown Potter and the Riedls, Mr.
Butler, and many others.</p>

<p>Monday I am giving a “bridge” for Lady C. I cannot
yet have any one for lunch or dinner, but I want to give
some little sign on her arrival. The Cardens are a very
great addition to an ever-narrowing circle.</p>

<p>Great Britain stands pat on its recognition of Huerta,
which adds greatly to his prestige in the eyes of his own
people, and is most welcome in view of the approaching
elections. We understand the ticket will be Huerta and
Blanquet, in spite of Washington’s frowns.</p>

<p>I do not know the real qualities of Blanquet, up to
now faithful supporter of Huerta and his Minister of
War. The dramatic fact that, in the firing-squad at
Querétaro, it was he who gave the <i lang="fr">coup de grâce</i> to Maximilian,
has always overtopped everything else. The
pictures of Maximilian in the National Museum, poor,
blond, blue-eyed gentleman, show him utterly unfitted
to grapple with the situation, though filled with the
best intentions. He was like some rabbit, or other helpless
animal, caught in a trap. When one has seen archdukes
on their native heaths, one realizes that they are
not of the material to wrestle with the descendants of
Montezuma; though I don’t know that we, in spite of all
our “efficiency,” are being any more successful!</p>

<p>Great Britain will be very polite, but will not depart
one hair’s-breadth from what it has decided on as its
Mexican policy, involving big questions, not alone of
prestige, but oil, railways, mines, etc. In fact, the
British reply to Mr. Bryan in to-day’s newspaper quite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
clearly says that England will be delighted to follow any
policy from Washington as long as it does not interfere
with what the British Foreign Office has decided to do.
They simply can’t understand our not protecting American
lives and interests. Their policy here is purely commercial,
while ours, alas! has come to be political.</p>

<p>Great excitement is predicted for Sunday, the day of
the election, but all the timid have to do is to stay at
home, <em>if</em> their curiosity permits.</p>

<p>The import duties are raised 50 per cent. from the
twenty-eighth of October. But it will, fortunately,
bear less heavily on the <i lang="es">frijoles</i>- and banana-eating part
of the population than on those who want breakfast-foods
and <i lang="fr">pâté de foie gras</i>.</p>

<p>A cook comes to-day, highly recommended, but I can
see just the sort of things she will turn out, if left to
herself—fried bananas, goat stew, etc. She comes accompanied
by her little girl of three. One of the washerwomen
also has a child with her, and there are tentative
remarks from other quarters regarding offspring.
But the house is so big that a few indwellers, more or
less, make no difference; and I am not sorry, in these
uncertain times, to harbor a few bright-eyed, soft-skinned,
silent brown babies under my roof. The handsome
Indian maid who came to the city from her <i lang="es">pueblo</i>,
because her stepfather was too attentive, has gone.
She simply vanished; but as the other servants, on inquiry,
don’t seem worried, I suppose it is all right. They
have a way of leaving after they get their month’s wages,
though their departure is generally preceded by some
such formality as declaring that their grandmother is
dead, or their aunt ill. Where they go is a mystery.</p>

<p>To-morrow we lunch at the Simon’s. He is the clever
French <i lang="fr">Inspecteur des Finances</i> of the Banco Nacional.
They have a handsome house in the Paseo, an excellent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
French <i lang="fr">chef</i>, and are most hospitable. She is witty and
cultivated; we sometimes call her “<i lang="fr">la belle cuisinière</i>.”
In the evening we dine with Rieloff, the musical German
consul-general, who will serve Beethoven and Bach
very beautifully, after dinner. I am very little disposed
to go out in the evening here, and N. is nearly always
busy with despatches until a late hour. There is something
in the air, nearly 8,000 feet in the tropics, which
discourages night life, even in normal times, and <i lang="es">tertulias</i><a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
of any kind are infrequent. At ten the streets
are deserted and the Mexicans all under some sort of
cover. Even in the big houses they take the most abstemious
of evening meals, and go to bed early, to be
ready for the exceeding beauty of the early morning.</p>

<p>All the foreigners here have nerves. What would be
peaceful, dove-like households at sea-level, become scenes
of breakage of all description at this altitude, and all
sorts of studies might be made on the subject of “air
pressure” on the life of man and woman. There is not
the accustomed amount of oxygen in the air and, with
all the burning-up processes of the body lessened, there
is an appalling strain on the nerves. Hence many tears!</p>

<p>I wonder if you ever got the book and letter I sent you
from the boat from Santander. I gave them, with ample
postage and a fat tip, to an attractive, barefooted,
proud-looking Spaniard, who had brought a letter on
board for some one. I told him they were for <i lang="es">mi madre</i>.
With a most courtly bow, hat in one hand, the other on
his heart, he assured me that he would attend to the
matter as if it were for his <em>own</em> mother! <i lang="es">Pues quién sabe?</i></p>


<h3><em>October 24th.</em></h3>

<p>Yesterday at noon, Huerta, surrounded by his entire
Cabinet, received the Diplomatic Corps, and, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
there was much excitement beforehand, when his remarks
were boiled down, nothing was changed. The Mexican
is a past master at presenting the same condition under
some other expedient and disarmingly transparent disguise.
The way out of what we all considered a great
difficulty is amazingly simple. There will be no President
elected! Huerta declares he will not be a candidate,
and no one else will have the necessary majority.</p>

<p>The plain English of it all is—Huerta at the head of
the government as full-fledged military dictator. After
the formal statement of affairs he turned to N. and
begged him to assure Washington of his good faith; and he
reiterated that his sole aim was the pacification of Mexico.
He then became overpoweringly, embarrassingly
polite—even tender. He took N.’s arm and led him out
to have a <i lang="es">copita</i><a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> in the face of the assembled corps,
having previously embraced him, saying, with playful
reminiscence, “I arrest you.” Such are the vicissitudes
of representing the Stars and Stripes in Mexico! People
tell me Huerta’s speeches are generally masterpieces of
brevity, with something magnetic and human about
them. The English support has strengthened him, within
and without.</p>

<p>Sir L. and N. were snap-shotted together by indiscreet
newspaper men as they were leaving the <i lang="es">Palacio</i>. A
<i lang="fr">pièce à conviction</i>, if ever there was one. Sir L. was
laughingly apologetic for N.’s being “found so near the
body.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Lind left yesterday for the United States, and
I have written to the Governor, who may be lonely, to
tell him how welcome he would be if he likes to return
to Mexico City. I can make him comfortable—in a
bedroom and study adjoining—and we would really like
to see him. However, he may not care to come up for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
another <i lang="fr">fausse couche</i>, as one of the colleagues called
his first visit.</p>

<p>Everybody is expecting disorders on Sunday—Election
Day. There is very little difference between lawmakers
and lawbreakers in Mexico. We foreign devils
can scarcely keep our faces straight when we hear the
word “elections.” Sunday is sure to find Huerta still in
the saddle.</p>


<h3><em>October 25th.</em></h3>

<p>Yesterday L——, confidential agent of Felix Diaz, appeared
at luncheon-time. He is a clever and plausible
individual, angling for the United States recognition for
Diaz’s candidacy. A special train has been offered Felix
Diaz, but he is afraid, and not without reason, to venture
up into the unknown, so he will wait presidential results
at Vera Cruz, with its attractive harbor full of fast
ships.</p>


<h3><em>Tuesday, 28th.</em></h3>

<p>The great day of the elections—the 26th—passed off,
not only without disturbance, but without voters or
votes! The candidates so talked of during these last
days were conspicuous by their absence. Felix Diaz
was afraid to come to the capital, though all “assurances”—whatever
that may mean—had been given him.
In Vera Cruz he stayed at a second-rate hotel, next door
to the American Consulate—the Stars and Stripes,
doubtless, looking very comfortable from an accessible
roof-to-roof vantage-ground. He has missed, fatalistically,
it would seem, the occasions whereby he might
have become ruler of Mexico. He is a gentleman, rather
in our sense of the word, and the name he bears is linked
to the many glories of Mexico, but this is, probably, his
political burial. Already opportunity has called him
thrice—Vera Cruz, in 1912; then Mexico City, in February,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
1913; now again at Vera Cruz, in October, 1913;
and still another wields the destinies of Mexico.</p>

<p>The <i lang="fr">chers collègues</i> prophesy that we shall be here
until next May, when probably new elections will be
held. The consensus of opinion is that I might as well
get the much-discussed drawing-room curtains and the
rest, though I can’t feel enthusiastic about ordering a
lot of things that may come in only as I go out. The
dining-room continues to strike me as a terribly bleak
place, like all north rooms in the tropics.</p>

<p>I must say that one has very little hunger at this
height, where the processes of digestion are much slower
than at ordinary altitudes. When one has eaten a soup
of some sort, a dish of rice garnished with eggs, bacon,
and bananas (which any Mexican can do beautifully), or
one of the delicious light omelettes—<i lang="es">tortilla de huevos</i>—topped
off by some of the little, wild, fragrant strawberries
almost perennial here, and over which wine is
poured as a microbe-killer, one’s “engine is stoked” for
twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>There have just been the usual parleyings about the
brandy for the turkey—the <i lang="es">guajolote</i>, the Indians call
him—the ancestral bird of Mexico. The Aztecs ate, and
continue to eat, him; and good cooks have the habit of
giving him the following happy death: on the morning of
the day on which you are to eat him, you generally hear
him gobbling about. Then there is the demand for
whisky or brandy “<i lang="es">por el guajolote, pobrecito</i>.” The unfortunate
(or fortunate) bird is then allowed to drink
himself to death. This is the effective way of rendering
him chewable, it being impossible to hang meats at
this altitude. The flesh becomes soft and white and
juicy. But try a gravel-fed <i lang="es">guajolote</i> that has not gone
to damnation!</p>

<p>The food question is difficult here, anyway, and personally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
I am unable to wrestle with it. The far-famed
tropical fruits of this part of the world are most disappointing,
with the exception of the mango, with its clear,
clean, slightly turpentiny taste. There are many varieties
of bananas, but scarcely a decent one to be had,
such as any Italian push-cart is stocked with in New
York. The <i lang="es">chirimoya</i> has a custard-like taste—the <i lang="es">chico
zapote</i>, looking like a potato, has also, to our palate, a very
unpleasant, mushy consistency, and everything is possessed
of abnormally large seeds at the center. The
beautiful-looking, but tough, peaches that adorn our
tables come from California; also the large, rather withered
grapes.</p>

<h3><em>October 29th.</em></h3>

<p class="dropcap">The Minister for Foreign Affairs is now in the drawing-room,
from which I have fled, having asked to confer
with N. He has been frightened at the intervention
outlook and probably has come to try to find out what
Washington really has in store for Mexico. He said the
other day that the suspense was paralyzing to the
nation.</p>

<p>The British vice-consul at Palacio Gomez, Mr. Cunard
Cummings, came for lunch. He has had a thorough
experience with both rebels and Federals at Torreon, and
has terrible stories to tell of both sides. You don’t
change Mexican methods by draping them in different
banners. In fact, it isn’t the banner, here, but the
kind of hand carrying it, that makes the difference. He
told us how one night the rebels shot up the hospital
in his town, crowded with wounded whom he and the
doctors had left fairly comfortable. The next morning,
when he went back, his attention was first caught by
something dark and sticky dripping from the balcony,
as he went into the <i lang="fr">patio</i>. Up-stairs a dreadful sight was
presented by the overturned cots, the broken medicine-bottles,
and last, but not least, the <em>human</em> horrors.</p>

<p>Another tale is that of an ex-Deputy, de la Cadena,
who walked up the aisle of a church with clanking sword
and spurs, seized the priest officiating at Mass, and threw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
him and the sacred vessels out into the street, to the
consternation and terror of the humble worshipers.</p>

<p>Two federal military trains have been blown up during
the last week. Ninety persons were killed at one station
and, the day before, one hundred and two killed in the
same way at Lulu station. It is certainly a dance of
death.</p>


<h3><em>October 30th.</em></h3>

<p>Last night there was a very pleasant dinner at the
German Legation, at which I presided. I wore my
black satin Spitzer dress, with the white-and-silver hanging
sleeves, which was much admired. Everybody’s
clothes are known here and people are thankful to see
something new. The Belgian minister was on one side
of me, and the Japanese on the other. Von Hintze was
opposite, with Lady C. on his right, and Señora de Rul,
wearing magnificent pearls and a high-necked dress, on
his left. Three of the officers of the <em>Hertha</em> were there,
giving rise to uncomplicated jokes about “Hertha” and
“Huerta.” Of course conversation about <i lang="es">la situación</i>
twisted through the various courses. The opinion is
that there are enough warring elements in town to provide
a sort of spontaneous combustion, without the aid
of any outside happenings.</p>

<p>Moheno had evidently got word of the Cabinet meeting
in Washington, when he came to see N., yesterday.
He was most profuse in protestations of friendship, personal
and political. They are all a bit worried and perhaps
will be amenable to negotiations.</p>


<h3><em>October 31st.</em></h3>

<p>Yesterday there was a luncheon at May’s in honor of
the Belgians who have come to get the much-talked-of
railroad concession—a little matter of five thousand kilometers.
Everything is beautifully done at his house, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
he has many lovely works of art. The table was a mass of
small, yellow chrysanthemums in a beautiful, old English
porcelain <i lang="fr">surtout de table</i>, having a yellow <i lang="fr">fond</i>; the food
was the triumph of a French <i lang="fr">chef</i> over Mexican material.
But, like all houses facing north, the May’s house
seemed desperately chilly when one came in out of the
bright, fresh autumn day. Simon, the clever French
<i lang="fr">Inspecteur des Finances</i>, came in only when lunch was
nearly over. His wife had been in tears most of the time,
and we were all a bit jumpy—as there were rumors of
a raid on the bank, and we feared that he and the
other directors might have been asked for their money
or their lives. I invited them all for tea on Monday.
Graux, the chief engineer, has a handsome English wife.</p>

<p>When I see the fully furnished <i lang="fr">salons</i> of others, I long
for my Lares and Penates, so safe in Vienna; though, I
must say, the drawing-room has begun to look very
homelike and comfortable, with its deep chairs, broad
writing-desk, small tables, reading-lamps, palms, photographs,
books, and bibelots.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we went to a small tea in another
world than the political. It was given by Madame de
Riba, nee Garcia Pimentel, of the inner circle of the
aristocrats, where <i lang="es">el gobierno</i> is looked at from more or
less of a distance, and where foreigners seldom penetrate.
They are the delightful, charming people one
sees in the same set all over the world, and remind me of
the “cousinage” of the “first society” of Vienna. They
constantly intermarry, and, though they travel, they
rarely make foreign alliances, and are apt to return to
their own country, which, despite its political uncertainties,
is more beautiful than any other. There are
many works of art left in Mexico from the old Spanish
days, and in such houses one finds them. The handsome,
agreeable, amiable women, moreover, wear Paris<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
clothes and Cartier-set jewels; the men are dressed by
London tailors. The scene yesterday suggested any European
capital, and that inner circle where beauty,
wealth, and distinction abide. The members of this
inner circle are all in favor of the paternal form of government.
They themselves exercise a more or less beneficent
sway over the laborers on their big estates; and
they realize from experience the necessity of a highly
centralized government in this country, where, of the
fifteen millions of inhabitants, thirteen million are Indians,
and the other two million <i lang="es">gachupines</i>, <i lang="es">mestizos</i>,
foreigners of various sorts. Huerta once told N. that the
<i lang="es">gachupines</i> had spoiled a good race. He casts the stone
back as far as Cortés—rather a novel idea!</p>

<p>The bull-fight contingent from Spain arrives to-day.
There is great excitement, and with such a spur we all feel
that business ought to improve. Lack of money is the
crux of the whole situation in Mexico, and, with the
United States frowning on any nation that even hints at
a loan, the case seems desperate. Any one, however, can
afford a bull-fight ticket. If not for the more expensive
seats <i lang="es">en sombra</i> (in the shade), the people get a <i lang="es">boleto de
sol</i>, where they simmer blissfully in the sunny half of the
Ring.</p>

<p>I inclose a newspaper cutting about Bonilla, who was
in hiding here. He is celebrated for his blunders—<i lang="es">bonilladas</i>,
they are called. As a delicate expression
of his thanks, on his arrival at Washington, he sent N.
an open telegram announcing his safe arrival and ending
with messages of gratitude neatly calculated to make
trouble for his benefactor in both capitals.</p>

<p>I am finding myself very well off here, in the center of
daily occurrences of vital interest. A full plate of life!
One of its sweetnesses, doubtless, is that I don’t know
how long it will last. My tea-service is the only thing I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
really miss. A tent of a night I know—but the tea hour
comes every day!</p>


<h3><em>November 2nd.</em></h3>

<p>Last night came what is practically an ultimatum
from Washington to Huerta. He is to get out, he, and
all his friends, or—intervention. N. was at the palace
until one o’clock in the morning. It is asking Huerta to
commit political suicide, and he, unfortunately, does not
feel so inclined. Also, he has a conviction that he is a
sort of “Man of Destiny” who can bring peace to
Mexico. N. tried to convince him of the complete impossibility
of standing up against the United States, and
urged him again and again to give way. I was troubled
during the night by visions of intervention, further devastation
of this beautiful land, and the precious blood
of my own people.</p>

<p>I am reading a Spanish book on the war of 1847, published
in 1848. The reasons why battles were lost
sound immensely familiar—generals not coming up with
reinforcements, or the commissary not materializing, or
the troops deserting. It is all so like what we are reading
now in the newspapers! No <i lang="la">tempora mutantur</i> here.</p>


<h3><em>November 3rd.</em></h3>

<p>If Huerta feels himself in his last ditch, with this
threat of intervention, he may answer “<i lang="es">que vengan</i>.”
The upper classes here seem to feel that it is what we
intend and feel that if “’twere done, ’twere well ’twere
done quickly,” before the country is ruined. The bitter
pill will be sugar-coated by thoughts of the prosperity to
follow. A—— came this morning, and, after a long conversation
about Mexico’s troubles, cried: “Come in immediately
and clear up this impossible situation, or
leave us alone. Nothing is safe; nothing is sacred!”
His large sugar interests are in the Zapatista country,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
and he is pretty well ruined by their destruction. If we
come in, the military part is, perhaps, the least of it; a
huge administrative job would follow—Cuba and the
Philippines are mere child’s play to it.</p>

<p>A rather cryptic letter came from Mr. Lind this morning.
We gather that he is thinking of leaving, as he feels
that he can’t do anything! He has learned, as somebody
said, enough Spanish to say nothing in it. I think, however,
it is as difficult for the United States to withdraw
him as it was embarrassing to send him. Also a letter
came from Burnside, from Vera Cruz, telling of the war-ships
and their positions in the harbor. He predicts a
migration north for all of us, at an early date—but who
knows?</p>


<h3><em>November 4th.</em></h3>

<p>More battle-ships are announced. We shall have, according
to to-day’s paper, about 6,000 men at Vera
Cruz. Box-cars are being sent to the frontier; it must
all mean preparation for some definite stroke on the
part of the United States. I feel that I am seeing
life from a very big angle. In spite of the underlying
excitement here, outwardly things take their usual course.
Now we motor out to Tlalpam with the Belgian minister,
to lunch at Percival’s. It is a wondrous, glistening day,
and the swift run over the smooth, straight road toward
the enchanting hills which form its near background
will be pure joy. The mountains have a way of changing
their aspect as one motors along, even with one’s
eye on them. From being a breath, an emanation, they
become blue, purple realities of matchless beauty—dark
shadows pinned to them with spears of light.</p>

<p>The extremely delicate negotiations N. has been having
with the President’s private secretary, Rabago,
concerning Huerta’s possible resignation, have leaked
out, not from Mexico, but from the United States, and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
we suspect, <i lang="la">via</i> Vera Cruz. At the somewhat early hour
of two in the morning the press correspondents began to
come to the Embassy. It is now 11.30 and they have
been coming ever since.</p>

<p>N., of course, denies categorically having negotiations
on hand. Mr. Bryan, we see by the morning newspaper,
is reported as looking very pleased at the aspect of the
Mexican situation, on account of the aforesaid negotiations.
The correspondents here must be heaven-born.
Their scent is unerring. If there is anything even dreamed
of they appear in shoals; when things are in abeyance
you wouldn’t know there was one in town. They try,
naturally, to read something political into everything
that happens. For instance, the officers of the German
training-ship invited several of the ministers to take a
little trip to Vera Cruz, and the German, Russian, and
Norwegian ministers accepted—which is why the newspapers
had it that there was a meeting of plenipotentiaries
at Vera Cruz. They are on a hunting trip for two
days and will return to-morrow.</p>

<p>Felix Diaz has at last been landed at Havana (much
to the relief, I imagine, of the captain of the U. S. S.
<em>Wheeling</em>, on which ship he sought refuge) and his
political curtain has been rung down on this especial act.</p>


<h3><em>November 5th.</em></h3>

<p>Rabago is a very clever man, endowed to a high
degree with the peculiarly caustic type of Latin-American
wit, whose natural object here seems always to be Mexico’s
kaleidoscopic government. His paper <cite>El Mañana</cite> did
more than anything else to kill Madero by perseveringly
reflecting his weaknesses in a mirror of ridicule. On account
of his opposition to the Maderos and his Porfirista
sympathies he was taken up by the aristocratic class
and has been of immense service to Huerta, a sort of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
bridge between him and them. But how far the advice
to resign, which he swears that he has urged on Huerta,
will be followed remains to be seen. Huerta has a deep,
strange, Indian psychology entirely unfamiliar to us,
which is at work on the situation, and the results cannot
be predicted.</p>

<p>It was amusing to see the various ministers arrive at
the Embassy, one after the other, to assure N. that
there had been no conference of ministers at Vera
Cruz with Mr. Lind. They intend to uphold the protocol,
and wouldn’t be caught flirting with an unknown
official quantity behind N.’s back for anything in the
world.... Huerta easily gets suspicious and I dare say
the whole proceeding is spoiled. N. goes to-day with the
ultimatum to the President himself, and we shall see
what we shall see. It is all very uncertain, but intensely
interesting, in the magnetic, highly colored, Latin-American
way. It makes London, Paris, and New York seem
very banal.</p>

<p>Just home, after leaving N. at the <cite>Palacio</cite>, where the
answer to the ultimatum is supposed to be forthcoming.
All the clerks are here, in readiness to get off despatches.</p>

<p>On my way back I stopped at the Alameda for a
belated look at the booths stocked with the articles
appropriate, according to Aztec ideas, for All Saints’
Day and the Feast of the Dead. Countless Indians,
picturesque and mysterious, flood into the city, build
their booths, stay a few days, and then silently ebb
away, unseen until the next occasion—Christmas.
Great bunches of a yellow flower—<i lang="es">cinco llagas</i>, “Flower
of Death,” the Indians call it—are everywhere for sale,
to be placed afterward on the evanescent graves. Toy
death’s-heads and small toy coffins of all sorts abound.
A favorite device is one whereby a string is pulled, the
dead man raises his head, and when one lets go he falls<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
back with a rattling sound. It is all a bit <i lang="fr">macabre</i>, sold by
these imperturbable Indians of the plateau, who are far
from being a jovial race. Pulque and their other drinks
often induce silence and melancholy rather than hilarity.
They never sing nor whistle in the streets. They almost
never dance. If they go through a few figures it is mostly
in a solemn manner and on the occasion of some church
festival, when they dance and gesticulate, strangely garlanded,
in the <i lang="fr">patio</i> of the church itself.</p>

<p>The Alameda is a handsome park in the very middle
of the town, and marks the site of the old Aztec <i lang="es">tianguiz</i>,
or market-place. Fountains and flowers abound, and it
is lavishly planted with beautiful eucalyptus and palms;
an excellent band plays daily. The <i lang="es">pajarera</i> (aviary)
around which the children cluster is very poor, considering
the beauty and variety of the Mexican birds and
the Aztec traditions in this regard. The park has no
railing around it—one can stroll in from the broad Avenida
Juarez. The drawback to the stone benches, placed
at intervals, is that the most prominent have graven
upon them the words, “<i lang="es">Eusebio Gayosso</i>”—the name of
the <em>popular undertaker</em>. In the midst of life you are in
death there. However, the eternal Indians, sunning
themselves and their offspring on the benches, can’t
read; they have this advantage over any <i lang="es">ilustrado</i> who
might want to rest a bit.</p>

<p>N. has just returned with the anxiously awaited answer,
which is quite beside the point. Huerta is probably
sparring for time. He proffers vague, pleasant words
in answer to the very definite message of the President,
to the effect that he has always been animated by the
most patriotic desires, that he will always limit his
acts to the law, and that after the elections he will
scrupulously respect the public wish and will recognize
any person elected as President for the term to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
30th of November, 1916. N. recommends the withdrawal
of the Embassy if, after the 23d of this month,
when a new congress is to be convened, Huerta has not
resigned. This might influence Huerta; and again, he
may consider it only another cry of wolf.</p>

<p>The fact is, nobody believes we really will intervene.
The chances that we shall depart on a war-ship instead
of by the Ward Line are very good, the “d” in this instance
making all the difference. I shall hate to leave
this palpitating, prismatic sort of life; but it isn’t
the moment to have personal feelings of any sort.</p>

<p>Driving back this evening toward a beautiful, clear,
red sunset, up the Plateros between the rows of autos
and carriages full of handsomely dressed people, the
men standing along the edge of the pavement as they
do in Rome on the Corso, it seemed impossible that I
was looking at a people over whom a great national
humiliation was hanging. The crowds become more
and more Mexican every day, with fewer American
faces.</p>

<p>We lunched to-day with the Iturbides. Everything
was done in the best of style—with beautiful old silver and
porcelain. He is a descendant of the Emperor Augustin
Iturbide of tragic history, and a charming and very
clever young man who would adorn any society. Señor
Bernal, with his Christus head, its extreme regularity
chiseled in pale, ivory tones, sat on my other side. They
all seemed to fear that in view of the, to them, inexplicable
attitude of the United States, the end in Mexico
would be the long-dreaded intervention in some form.
Not a man who was at the table, however, really occupies
himself with politics. They all have handsome
houses in town, but they live for the most part on their
haciendas, which they work on the paternal plan, the
only plan as yet productive of results here and which we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
in the United States don’t at all understand, not being
able to put ourselves into another nation’s shoes. The
actual political business here is left to the educated
middle class, whose members, instead of being pillars of
society, form the stratum from which the professional
politician and embryo revolutionist always spring—the
<i lang="es">licenciados</i>, sometimes called the curse of Mexico, and
other men of the civil professions, generally venal to a
degree. The peon is faithful when he has no power and
the aristocrat is noble; but no country is secure whose
best elements are the extremes.</p>

<p>I am not, however, pessimistic as to the future of the
real Latin-American typified by this middle stratum,
generally <i lang="es">mestizo</i>. He always forms the active part of
the population, and in his hands seems to lie the future
of the country. The Spaniard as typified by the aristocratic
classes is apt to hold himself aloof and will
always do so. The Indian, except in the isolated case of
some individual possessing genius, sure to present himself
from time to time, has not the qualities to form the
dominant element. It is, therefore, reserved for this
crossing of Spaniard and native to finally embody and
present the real national characteristics.</p>

<p>A rumor is out to-night that, as the present banking
act relative to certain reserves of gold and silver doesn’t
suit Huerta, he has decided to do away with it, and we
are to stand firmly (?) on paper. Shades of Limantour!</p>

<p>This afternoon I bought several beautiful old inlaid
frames. These last words tell of one of the greatest
pleasures in Mexico—prowling around for antiques.
Almost every one coming down here gets the fever and
spends hours turning over junk, in an almost delirious
way, in the hope of unearthing treasure. In spite of the
fact that for almost fifty years Mexico has been drained
by the traveler, and again and again devastated by civil<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
strife, there still remain endless lovely things, testifying
to the wealth and taste of the old Spanish days.</p>


<h3><em>November 6th.</em></h3>

<p>The statement in the <cite>Mexican Herald</cite> that Mr. Lind
had confirmed the report of an ultimatum and the probable
failure of negotiations is simply astounding. Turn
the light of publicity on Huerta and he is as wary as
some wild animal who comes into contact with man for
the <em>second</em> time. Whatever he may have been contemplating,
these special negotiations are now dead and
buried.</p>

<p>There was a big dinner at the Belgian Legation to-night;
everything beautifully done, as usual. I sat opposite
my host, between von H. and Sir L. Wore the
flowered black velvet chiffon, and that black aigrette
with the Pocahontas effect in my hair; von H. wanted
to know why this delicate Indian tribute. There was no
political conversation, as, with the exception of the C.’s,
von H., and ourselves, only handsome, well-dressed, and
bejeweled members of the Mexican smart set were present.
May is nothing if not exclusive, with a perfect
<em>flair</em> for the <i lang="es">chicheria</i>. His handsome wife is in Paris.</p>

<p>My drawing-room is filled with the beautiful pink
geraniums that grow thick on the walls of the Embassy
gardens and balconies. Juan, the gardener, who, like
all Aztecs, understands flowers, brings them in every
other morning, cutting them most effectively with very
long stems and many leaves.</p>

<p>“Ship ahoy!” in the harbor of Vera Cruz no longer
excites attention. Counting the French and German
ships, there are about a dozen in all. Seven belong to
us. There were only two—the <em>New Hampshire</em> and the
<em>Louisiana</em>—guarding the entrance to the channel when
we arrived a month ago. Is the plot thickening?</p>

<h3><em>November 7th.</em></h3>

<p class="dropcap">The newspaper with the announcement that Mr.
Lind had left Vera Cruz last night for Mexico
City was brought up on my breakfast tray. I have had
two rooms made ready for him, moving rugs and desks
and furniture about, robbing Peter to pay Paul, as one
does in an incompletely furnished house. He will be
welcome, and I hope comfortable, as long as he sees
fit to stay. I bear the memory of something magnetic,
something disarming of criticism, in his clear, straight
gaze, blue viking eye, his kindly smile, and his tall,
spare figure, clothed, not dressed. He won’t find it
easy here and I don’t think any Mexican official sporting
the oak of the protocol will receive him unless he is
accompanied by N.—a sort of political, Siamese-twin
effect, and of a superfluity.</p>


<h3><em>Later.</em></h3>

<p>When I got down-stairs Mr. Lind was in N.’s study.
To greet him I had to get through a swarm of newspaper
men clustering like bees around the honey-pot of
“copy.” I presented him, so to speak, with the keys of
the borough, and retreated to my own bailiwick to order
luncheon for one o’clock. The whole town is whispering
and wondering what it all will mean. Huerta remains
silent. It appears that he and his generals are now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
<em>willing</em> to make headway against the rebels. Why not
before? A hundred years ago “dips” were sent to
Constantinople to learn a thing or two they hadn’t
known before. Now, I think, Mexico is as good a school
for the study of other points of view.</p>

<p>Mr. Lind makes no secret of his conviction of the
hostile intentions of England in the Mexican situation;
but I have difficulty in thinking that to save her interests
here, big though they be, England would ever
do anything to jeopardize our friendship. In last week’s
<cite>Multicolor</cite> there was a picture of the White House, with
England, Germany, and France in the act of painting it
green. <i lang="es">Poner verde</i> is to insult.</p>

<p>Huerta feels that he has the support of many foreign
powers, especially of England. Sir L., by presenting
his credentials the morning after the <i lang="fr">coup d’état</i>, stiffened
him up considerably.</p>


<h3><em>November 8th.</em></h3>

<p>We have been busy these past two days. Mr. L. is
a delightful guest, easy and simple. He goes to-morrow,
but I am pressing him to return for Thanksgiving—<em>if</em>
we are here. People smile when I speak of a Thanksgiving
reception. Three weeks is a long cry in Mexico City,
in these days.</p>

<p>N. finally ran Huerta down yesterday in the <cite>El Globo</cite>
café. He received the usual affectionate <i lang="es">abrazo</i>,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and
they had a <i lang="es">copita</i> together, but Huerta never mentioned
Lind any more than if he were non-existent, and
shied off at the remotest hint of “business.” Instead, he
asked N., “How about the girls?” (“<i lang="es">Y las muchachas?</i>”)
a phrase often used for opening or closing a conversation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
in these climes, much as we would ask about the weather.
It has no bearing on whatever subject may be in hand.</p>

<p>The new elections are to be held on the 23d of this
month. Huerta plays with the government in Washington
in a truly Machiavellian way. They want his resignation,
but for the moment there is no recognized government
in whose hands to place such a resignation.
After the 23d, if the elections bear fruit, he will find some
other reasons for remaining. If it were not for the fact
that might is always right, the Administration would be
as the kindergarten class, in regard to this clever, involved,
astute old Indian. “They say” he is getting
rich, but there are no apparent signs. I don’t think his
mentality is that of the money-loving order, though
possibly his principles would not prevent his making
himself comfortable if he put his mind to it. He is now,
however, so under the domination of his <i lang="fr">idée fixe</i>—pacification—in
spite of the difficulties within and without,
that I doubt if he is taking an undue interest in personal
enrichment.</p>


<h3><em>November 9th.</em></h3>

<p>This morning I began the day by telephoning von
Hintze to come for lunch, as Mr. Lind wanted to see
him informally. Then I went to the house of the Chilian
<i lang="fr">chargé</i>, who died yesterday. He was laid out in the
center of the little dining-room, the electric bell from the
hanging lamp, which he must often have pressed while
eating, dangling over his poor, dead face. There is a
quite particular sadness about the passing away of
diplomats in lands distant from their own, their little
span spun among the polite, but the unrelated and uncaring.
I stayed for a rosary and litany, the priest, his
pretty, childless wife, and myself, alone in the room.
Great hangings of purple bougainvillæa, the glory of
Mexico, darkened the window. May he rest in peace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span></p>

<p>There was interesting conversation at lunch, only
we four being present. Mr. Lind repeated to von Hintze
what he has, curiously enough, said to many people here—his
opinion that the crux of the matter was the Anglo-American
relations, and that the United States would
never allow the dominance of British interests to the
injury of American or Mexican ones; von Hintze, though
he listened attentively, was non-committal and most
diplomatic in his answers. It is always of absorbing
interest to Germans to hear of possible difficulties between
England and other nations, and <i lang="la">vice versa</i>, too, for
that matter. A light springs into the eye; and I dare
say von Hintze made a report to his home government
on returning to the Legation. He told Mr. Lind he
thought we had not sufficiently respected the <i lang="fr">amour
propre</i> of the Mexicans; that we were wrong in trying
threats when what they needed was skilful coaxing.
Mr. Lind volunteered the surprising statement that it
didn’t suit us to have the elections held, anyway, as
there would be concessions granted and laws passed that
would render the Mexican situation difficult for us for
fifty years. I really felt quite embarrassed.</p>

<p>The Vera Cruz elections amused Mr. Lind considerably,
the “urn” being a common pasteboard shoe-box
with a slit in it. This <i lang="fr">objet de vertu</i> he had actually
seen with his own eyes.</p>

<p>The town is wild over the bull-fight this Sunday afternoon.
Belmonte, <i lang="es">el fenomeno</i>, just arrived from Spain,
twenty-one years old, is the object of all affections. Political
matters are quite in abeyance. There was a
scarcely subdued excitement among the servants as the
gay throng passed the Embassy <i lang="fr">en route</i> for the Ring, and
considerable dejection this evening because all hadn’t
been able to stampede the house and hie them to
the fray. They are like children; any disappointment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
seems the end of everything. A continual cloud of dust
wrapped us about, stirred up by the thousands passing
in motor, carriage, or on foot. During my first Mexican
sojourn I went to two bull-fights, but didn’t acquire
the taste. De Chambrun told me one had to go six
times running, after which one couldn’t be kept away!</p>

<p>I saw Belmonte driving yesterday, the crowds cheering
wildly. His expression of pride, yet condescension, distinguished
him as much as his clothes. He wore the
usual flat black hat, showing his tiny pigtail, a wide-frilled
shirt under a tight jacket which didn’t pretend to
meet the still tighter trousers, and he was covered with
jewelry—doubtless votive offerings from adoring friends.
And to-night he may be dead!</p>

<p>Burnside and Ensign H., of the <em>Louisiana</em>, who accompanied
Lind as body-guard, return with him to
Vera Cruz. The Embassy is to engage a compartment
for him in the evening, but he will go in the morning.
Just as well to be prepared against “accidents.”</p>


<h3><em>November 11th.</em></h3>

<p>We lunch at the German Legation to-day, with Mr.
Lind. He hasn’t any clothes, but as he doesn’t work
along those lines I suppose it doesn’t matter. There is
no question of the tailor making this man.</p>

<p>A heavenly, transforming sun, for which I am giving
thanks, shines in at my windows. I am going out to do
some “junking” with Lady C. With exchange three for
one, every now and then some one does unearth something
for nothing. The Belgian minister, who has money
and <i lang="fr">flair</i>, makes the most astounding finds. He got
for a song what seems to be an authentic enamel of
Diane de Poitiers, in its original frame—a relic of the
glories of the viceroys.</p>

<p>Something that developed in a conversation with Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
Lind has been making me a bit thoughtful, and more
than a little uneasy. He has the idea, perhaps the plan,
of facilitating the rebel advance by raising the embargo,
and I am afraid he will be recommending it to Washington.
We had been sitting, talking, after dinner, shivering
in the big room over a diminutive electric stove,
when he first tentatively suggested such action. I exclaimed:
“Oh, Mr. Lind! You can’t mean that! It would
be opening a Pandora box of troubles here.” Seeing how
aghast I was, he changed the subject. But I cannot get
it out of my head. The Mexican book is rolled out like
a scroll before him; can it be that he is not going to
read it? Any measures tending to undermine the central
authority here, imperfect though it be, can only
bring calamity. I witnessed that at first hand in the disastrous
overturning of the Diaz rule and the installation
of the ineffective Madero régime. I think Madero was
more surprised than any one that, after having taken so
much trouble to help him in, we took so little to <em>keep</em>
him in. The diplomats are forever insisting that Diaz’s
situation in 1877 was analogous to Huerta’s now, and
that after a decently permissible delay of ten months,
or whatever it was, we recognized him. So why not
Huerta? He, at least, is in possession of the very delicate
machinery of Mexican government, and has shown
some understanding of how to keep it going.</p>


<h3><em>Later.</em></h3>

<p>The lunch at the German Legation was most interesting.
Lind, Rabago, the Belgian minister, and ourselves
were the guests. Rabago doesn’t speak a word of English,
and Mr. Lind not a word of Spanish, so there was a
rather scattered conversation. Everybody smiled with
exceeding amiability—all to show how safe we felt on
the thin ice. The colleagues are always very polite, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
none of them is really with us as regards our policy.
Standing with von Hintze by the window for a few minutes
after lunch, I used the word intervention, and von
Hintze said something about the unpreparedness of the
United States for war. This, though true, I could not
accept unchallenged from a foreigner. I answered that
if war were declared, we would have a million men at the
recruiting offices between sunrise and sunset. It sounded
patriotic and terrifying, but it was rendered rather ineffective
by his reply, “Men, yes, but not soldiers.
Soldiers are not made between sunrise and sunset.” He
added something about the apparent divergence in public
opinion in the States, and threw a bit of Milton at me in
the shape of “not everybody thinks they serve who only
stand and wait.” Ignoring this quotation from the
blind bard, I said that whatever the divergence of public
opinion might be <em>before</em> war, the nation would be
as one man with the President <em>after</em> any declaration.
I also told him we did not regard the Mexican situation
so much as a military situation as a police and administrative
job, which we were unwilling to undertake. I
then made my adieux, leaving the “junta” in full
swing, the Belgian minister’s agile tongue doing wonders
of interpretation between Lind and Rabago. The
result of the palaver, however, as I heard afterward
from the various persons who took part, was <em>nil</em>.</p>

<p>Mr. Lind keeps me on the <i lang="fr">qui vive</i> by predictions of a
rupture in the next few days. He is naturally becoming
impatient and would like things to come to a head. I
have not drawn a peaceful breath since landing.</p>

<p>Runs on the banks to draw out silver in exchange for
paper have complicated matters. When I went this
morning to the Banco Internacional I saw people standing
at the paying-teller’s desk, with big canvas bags in
which to carry off silver. Since the law to coin more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
silver has been passed, I should say that each patriot
intends to do his best to line his own cloud with that
material.</p>


<h3><em>November 12th.</em></h3>

<p>A telegram came from Washington last night. Rupture
of diplomatic relations unless Huerta accedes to our
demands. N. has taken it to the Foreign Office, to
Rabago and to Garza Aldape, to prove to them that,
though they may not believe it, we are ready to take
strenuous measures. It is all more like being on a volcano
than near one. Neither the Mexican nation, nor
any other, for that matter, believes we are ready and
able to go to war; which, of course, isn’t true, as we
may be called upon to show. War is not, to my mind,
anyway, the greatest of evils in the life of a nation.
Too much prosperity is a thousand times worse; and
certainly anarchy, as exemplified here, is infinitely more
disastrous. We ourselves were “conceived in wars, born
in battle, and sustained in blood.”</p>

<p>We hope the <em>Louisiana</em> went to Tuxpan last night,
and that she will shell out the rebels there who are in
full enjoyment of destruction of life and property. It
would give them all a salutary scare. There are huge
English oil interests there. The owners are all worried
about their property and generally a bit fretful at the
uncertainty. Will we protect their interests or will we
allow them to? <em>Our</em> government gave warning that
it would not consider concessions granted during the
Huerta régime as binding on the <em>Mexicans</em>. It makes
one rub one’s eyes.</p>


<h3><em>Later.</em></h3>

<p>Things Mexican seem approaching their inevitable
end. At three o’clock to-day N. showed Rabago the
telegram from Washington about the probable breaking
off of diplomatic relations. He turned pale and said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
he would arrange an interview with the President for
six o’clock. At six o’clock N., accompanied by Mr.
Lind, presented himself at the Palace. Neither President
nor secretary was there. Rabago finally telephoned
from some unknown place that he was looking for Huerta,
but could not find him. Some one suggested that he
might at that time be closeted with the only “foreigners”
he considered really worth knowing—Hennessy
and Martell.</p>

<p>Mr. Lind came for a moment to the drawing-room to
tell me that he leaves to-night at 8.15. He thinks we
will be following him before Saturday—this being Wednesday.
The continual sparring for time on the part of
the government and a persistently invisible President
have got on his nerves. He hopes, by his sudden departure,
to bring things to a climax, but climaxes, as we of the
north understand them, are hard to bring about in Latin
America. The one thing not wanted is definite action.
Mr. Lind said, in a convincing manner, as he departed,
that he would arrange for rooms for us in Vera Cruz. He
knows it is N.’s right to conduct any business connected
with the breaking off of relations, which he seems sure
will be decided on at Washington, and he realizes that
N. has borne the heat and burden of the Mexican
day. He seems more understanding of us than of
the situation, alas! I said Godspeed to him with tears
in my eyes. Vague fears of impending calamity press
upon me. How is this mysterious and extraordinary
people fitted to meet the impending catastrophe—this
burning of the forest to get the tiger?</p>

<p>An American citizen, Krauss, has been put without
trial in the Prison of Santiago, where he has come down
with pneumonia. N. has sent a doctor to him with
d’Antin, who has been for years legal adviser and translator
to the Embassy, and is almost, if not <em>quite</em>, a Mexican.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
They found the American in a long, narrow corridor,
with eighty or ninety persons lying or sitting about;
there was scarcely stepping-room, and the air was horrible;
there were few peons among the prisoners, who
were mostly men of education—political suspects. One
aspect of a dictatorship!</p>

<p>Garza de la Cadena, the man I wrote you about (who
seized the priest at the altar and threw him into the
street in Gomez Palacio), was shot yesterday, by his own
rebels, for some treachery—a well-deserved fate. He
was taken out at dawn near Parral, placed against an
adobe wall, and riddled with bullets.</p>

<p>This morning I was reading of the breaking off of our
relations with Spain in 1898. Most interesting, and
possibly to the point. History has a way of repeating
itself with changes of names only. I wonder will the
day come when N.’s name and Algara’s figure as
did General Woodford’s and Polo de Bernabé’s? Various
horrors take place here, but no one fact, it seems to
me, can equal the dwindling of the population of the
“green isle of Cuba” (indescribably beautiful as one
steams along its shores), which dropped from 1,600,000
to 1,000,000 in ten months—mostly through hunger.
Mothers died with babes at their breasts; weak, tottering
children dug the graves of their parents. Good
God! How could it ever have happened so near to us?
However, <em>they</em> are all safe—“<i lang="es">con Dios</i>.”</p>

<p>Now we take a hurried dinner, at which Mr. Lind,
Captain B., and Ensign H. had been expected, and then
N. goes “big-game hunting” again. It bids fair to be a
busy night.</p>

street cries—Garza Aldape resigns—First official
Reception at Chapultepec Castle—The jewels of Cortés.</p>


<h3><em>November 13th.</em></h3>

<p class="dropcap">The President was not trackable last night, though
N. kept up the search until a late or, rather, an early
hour. It certainly is an efficient, if not satisfactory, way
of giving answer—just to subtract yourself from the
situation.</p>

<p>N. will not present himself at the convening of Congress
on Saturday, the 15th. His absence will make a
big hole in the <i lang="fr">Corps Diplomatique</i>.</p>

<p>Several reporters were here early this morning to say
they had positive information that Huerta had fled the
country. But Mexico City as a rumor factory is unexcelled,
and one no longer gets excited over the <i lang="fr">on
dits</i>. Moreover, nothing, probably, is further from
Huerta’s mind than flight. From it all emerged one
kernel of truth: Mr. Lind had left for Vera Cruz without
satisfaction of any kind.</p>

<p>The Belgian minister came in yesterday just as Mr.
Lind was leaving. He begged him not to go, to refrain
from any brusque action calculated to precipitate a
rupture that might be avoided. But I can’t see that
any one’s coming or going makes any difference. The
abyss is calling the Mexicans and they will fall into it
when and how they please.</p>

<p>I have gone so far as to tell Berthe to pack my clothes.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
The things in the drawing-rooms I will leave—and lose
if necessary. It would create a panic if any one came in
and saw the rooms dismantled. No one can tell what is
really impending. The American editor who remarked
that what we take for an Aztec Swan Song is generally
only another yelp of defiance is about right.</p>

<p>The five days’ siege of Chihuahua was ended yesterday
by a Federal victory. The rebels lost about nine hundred
men. The corpses of the latter were very well dressed,
many wearing silk underclothing, the result of the looting
of Torreon, which the rebels took several weeks ago.
The Chihuahua victory will probably strengthen the
provisional government if anything can. The generals,
including Orozco, who fought against Madero, have been
promoted.</p>

<p>Night before last the train on the Inter-oceanic between
Mexico City and Vera Cruz was held up by rebel
bandits for two hours. Everybody was robbed and
terrorized. The rebels had in some way got news of the
large export of bullion on the train. There was so much
that they could not have carried it off, even if they
hadn’t been frightened in the midst of their raid by a
hastily summoned detachment of Federals. If we depart
I don’t care to chaperon silver bars to the port. And
N. says he would like Huerta to sit on the seat with him
all the way down.</p>

<p>I wonder if the government will be so huffed at the
non-appearance of the American representative on
Saturday that the Sabbath will see us on the way, with
our passports? Probably men may come and men may
go (<i lang="la">vide</i> Mr. Lind), coldness and threats may be tried
on them, and they will continue to let everything go
till the United States is actually debarking troops at
the ports and pouring them over the frontier. Masterly
inaction with a vengeance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span></p>

<p>I have an idea that Washington is not in accord with
Mr. Lind’s impatience to end the situation by a rupture
of diplomatic relationship. Once broken off, we would
be faced by an urgent situation, demanding immediate
action. Perhaps it <em>is</em> true that we are not efficiently
ready for intervention, besides not wanting it. As long
as N. stays the wheels will be oiled.</p>


<h3><em>November 14th.</em></h3>

<p>Last night the atmosphere cleared—for a while, at
least. Congress will not be convened to-morrow, which
puts quite a different aspect on things. If it had been
held, Mexico would have been the only country, by the
way, able to display a triplicate set of Congressmen,
<i lang="la">i. e.</i>, those in jail, those elected since the <i lang="fr">coup d’état</i>, and
the last new ones.</p>

<p>Sir L. called yesterday to offer his services. Great
Britain knows she must be in accord with us. Many
other colleagues also called, fearing some trouble when
it was understood that N. was not to attend the opening
and that the United States proposed to declare null and
void any act of the Congress. Quite a flutter among the
expectant <i lang="fr">concessionaires Belges</i>! It all had a very
salutary effect. There is no use in any of the Powers
trying to “rush” the United States, no matter what their
interests on the Western Hemisphere.</p>


<h3><em>Later.</em></h3>

<p>President Wilson has decided to delay the announcement
of his new Mexican policy. Incidentally, I told
Berthe to unpack. Well, we will all be quiet until something
else turns up. Hundreds of dollars’ worth of cables
went out from the Embassy yesterday, N. dictating for
hours and the clerks coding. Several of them are sleeping
at the Embassy, anyway—so much night work that
they are needed on the ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span></p>

<p>I am giving this letter to M. Bourgeois, the French
consul-general, leaving on the <i lang="es">Espagne</i>, next week. He
is an agreeable man of the world, who has just been
assigned to Tientsin.</p>


<h3><em>Evening, 10 o’clock.</em></h3>

<p>Matters very serious. N. is to deliver to-night what
is practically an ultimatum. He called up Manuel
Garza Aldape, Minister of Gobernación (Interior), and
arranged for an interview with him at his house at nine
o’clock. Then he rang up the ministers he needs as witnesses,
to accompany him there.</p>

<p>Von Hintze arrived first. When he had read the paper
here in the drawing-room he said, after a silence, “This
means war.” (Some one had intimated such a possibility
on Wednesday last, to Garza Aldape, and he had answered,
quietly, “It <em>is</em> war.”) Von Hintze went on to say:
“Huerta’s personal position is desperate. Whether he
fights the rebels in the north or the United States, it is
disaster for him. Only, I fancy, he has less to lose in the
way of prestige if he chooses the United States. His
nation will make some show of rallying around him in
this latter case.” Von Hintze is persuaded that we are
not ready for war, practically or psychologically. He
kept repeating to N.: “But have you represented to your
government what all this will eventually lead to?” N.
answered “Washington is justly tired of the situation.
For six months our government has urged and threatened
and coaxed. It doesn’t want any more useless explanations.
It is too late.”</p>

<p>However, until the note is in Huerta’s hands it is
not official. So I still hope. Garza Aldape is one of the
best of the ministers.</p>

<p>I went with von Hintze and N. to the big front door
and watched the motor disappear in the darkness. Delicious
odors from the geraniums and heliotrope in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
garden enveloped the house, but after a moment I came
back, feeling very still. The idea of American blood
watering the desert of Chihuahua grips my heart. I can
see those dry, prickly cactus stubs sticking up in the sand.
No water anywhere! During the Madero revolution a
couple of hundred Mexicans died there of thirst, and
they knew their country. I kept looking about my comfortable
drawing-room, with its easy-chairs and photographs,
books and bowls of flowers, and saying to myself:
“So that is the way wars are made.” This putting
of another’s house in order is getting on my nerves.</p>

<p>The telephone has been ringing constantly. The journalists
have had indications from Washington that something
is impending.</p>


<h3><em>Saturday, November 15th.</em></h3>

<p>N. came in last night at half past twelve, after a
three hours’ conference with Aldape. He is to see him
again at ten this morning. They say that the presence
of Mr. Lind gives publicity to every step, that their
national dignity is constantly imperiled, and that it is
impossible to negotiate under such conditions. Aldape
also said that Huerta flies into such a rage whenever
Lind’s name is mentioned that conversation becomes
impossible.</p>


<h3><em>Later.</em></h3>

<p>Things are very strenuous to-day. N. saw Garza
Aldape at ten. He said he had passed a sleepless night,
after their conference, and had not yet presented the
ultimatum to Huerta. N. asked him if he were afraid
to do so, and he answered, quite simply, “Yes.” N. told
him he would return at three o’clock, and if by that
time the note had not been presented through the regular
channels, he would do it himself.</p>

<p>The outlook is very gloomy. Carranza in the north
has refused the offices of W. B. Hale as mediator, saying,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
“No foreign nation can be permitted to interfere in
the interior matters of Mexico.” If Carranza says that,
certainly Huerta cannot say less. So there we are.
Though nothing was further from his purpose, Mr.
Lind has absolutely knocked any possible negotiations
on the head by the noise and publicity of his arrival in
the city of Montezuma <em>and</em> Huerta. The Latin-American
may know that you know his affairs, and know that you
know he knows you know; but he does not want and
will not stand publicity.</p>

<p>This morning I went out “junking” at the Thieves’
Market with Lady C. It seemed to us that all the rusty
keys in the world, together with all the locks, door-knobs,
candlesticks, spurs, and family chromos were on
exhibition. We were just leaving when my eye fell on
a beautiful old blue-and-white Talavera jar, its metal
top and old Spanish lock intact. After considerable
haggling I ended by giving the shifty-eyed Indian more
than he had ever dreamed of getting, and much less
than the thing was worth. Drugs, sweetmeats, and valuables
of various kinds used to be kept in these jars.
Greatly encouraged, I dragged Lady C. to the Monte
de Piedad. All foreigners as well as natives frequent it,
hoping, in vain, to get a pearl necklace for what one
would pay for a string of beads elsewhere. One of the
monthly <i lang="es">remates</i>, or auctions, was going on, and the
elbowing crowd of peons and well-dressed people, together
with the familiar Aztec smell, made us feel it
was no place for us. The diamonds and pearls here are
mostly very poor, and the great chunks of emeralds
with their thousand imperfections are more decorative
than valuable. The fine jewels of the wealthy class have
come mostly from Europe, though shrewd buyers are
on the lookout for possible finds in the constant turnover
of human possessions. There are beautiful opals<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
to be had in Mexico, but you know I wouldn’t touch
one, and the turquoise has been mined from time immemorial.
The museums everywhere are full of them
as talismans and congratulatory gifts, to say nothing of
the curio-shops.</p>

<p>Cortés, it appears, was very fond of jewels, and was
always smartly dressed in fine linen and dark colors, with
one handsome ornament. When he went back to Spain
he set all the women crazy by the jewels he took with
him. Emeralds, turquoises, gold ornaments, and <i lang="es">panaches</i>
of plumes of the <i lang="es">quetzal</i> (bird of paradise) cunningly
sewn with pearls and emeralds, after the Aztec fashion,
were distributed with a lavish hand. The presents for
his second wife were so splendid that the queen became
quite jealous, though he had made her wonderful offerings.
It is hinted that this was the beginning of his disfavor
at court.</p>


<h3><em>November 17th.</em></h3>

<p>Yesterday, which began so threateningly, ended without
catastrophe. On opening the morning newspaper,
I saw that Garza Aldape had resigned. He finally presented
the American note to Huerta, with the result
that he also presented his own demission and leaves
almost immediately for Vera Cruz, to sail on the <i lang="es">Espagne</i>
for Paris, where, it is rumored, he will be minister in
place of de la Barra. Anyway, it is his exit from
Huertista politics. He is a gentleman and a man of
understanding. The way Huerta has of dispersing his
Cabinet is most unfortunate.</p>

<p>Yesterday there was another little luncheon at Tlalpam.
We sat in the beautiful, half-neglected garden
till half past four among a riot of flowers in full bloom,
callas, violets, roses, geraniums, and heliotrope on every
side. The two white, distant volcanoes crowned as ever
the matchless beauty of the scene about us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span></p>

<p>What the diplomats are fearing in the event of N.’s
withdrawal is the interregnum <em>after</em> our departure and
before the American troops could get here. They foresee
pillaging of the city and massacre of the inhabitants;
as their natural protectors, the Federal troops, would be
otherwise occupied, fighting “the enemy”—<i lang="la">i. e.</i>, us!
They always say Washington would be held responsible
in such an event, by the whole world, but this
thought does not seem to comfort them much. The
ineradicable idea among all foreigners is that we are
playing a policy of exhaustion and ruin in Mexico by
non-recognition, so that we will have little or no difficulty
when we are ready to grab. One can talk oneself
hoarse, explain, embellish, uphold the President’s
policy—it makes no difference: “It is like that.”</p>

<p>We came home after I had shown myself with Elim
at the Country Club on our way in. People are in a
panic here, but no one has heard anything from <em>me</em>
except that I expect to receive on Thanksgiving Day
from four to eight. The telephones are being rung all
day by distracted fathers and husbands, not knowing
what to do. They cannot leave their daily bread.
They are not men who have bank accounts in New
York or in any other town, and to them leaving
means ruin. They come with white, harassed faces.
“Is it true that the Embassy is to be closed to-night?”
“What do you advise?” “It is ruin if I leave.”
“Can’t we count on any protection?” are a few of the
questions asked.</p>

<p>Dr. Ryan, the young physician who did such good
work during the <i lang="es">Decena Tragica</i> last February, is here
again. He has been in the north these last months,
where he saw horrid things and witnessed many executions.
He says the victims don’t seem to care for
their own lives or for any one’s else. They will stand up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
and look at the guns of the firing-squad, with big round
eyes, like those of deer, and then fall over.</p>

<p>As I write I hear the sad cry of the tamale-women,
two high notes, and a minor drop. All Mexican street
cries are sad. The scissors-grinder’s cry is beautiful—and
melancholy to tears.</p>

<p>I was startled as I watched the faces of some conscripts
marching to the station to-day. On so many was
impressed something desperate and despairing. They
have a fear of displacement, which generally means catastrophe
and eternal separation from their loved ones.
They often have to be tied in the transport wagons.
There is no system about conscription here—the press-gang
takes any likely-looking person. Fathers of families,
only sons of widows, as well as the unattached, are
enrolled, besides women to cook and grind in the powder-mills.
Sometimes a few dozen school-children parade
the streets with guns, escorted by their teachers. Unripe
food for cannon, these infants—but looking so
proud. These are all details, but indicative of the situation.</p>


<h3><em>November 18th.</em></h3>

<p>To-morrow Huerta and his señora are to receive at
Chapultepec, the first time they will have made use of
the official presidential dwelling. They are moving from
the rented house in the Calle Liverpool to one of their
own, a simple enough affair in the Mexican style, one
story with a <i lang="fr">patio</i>, in an unfashionable quarter.</p>

<p>As we are still “accredited,” I think we ought to go,
there being no reason why we should offer to Señora
Huerta the disrespect of staying away.</p>

<p>When we arrived in Mexico, beautiful Doña Carmen
Diaz was presiding; then came Señora de la Barra,
newly married, sweet-faced, and smiling; followed by
Señora Madero, earnest, pious, passionate. Now Señora<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
Huerta is the “first lady”—all in two years and a half.
The dynasties have a way of telescoping in these climes.</p>

<p>The invitation to the opening of Congress to-morrow
has just come in—exactly as if the United States had
not decided that no such Congress should be convened
and its acts be considered null and void.</p>

<p>Elim told me to-day that all the children he plays with
have gone away—“afraid of the revolution,” he added,
in a matter-of-fact voice. He expects to die with me if
“war” does come, and is quite satisfied with his fate.</p>

<p>The details of Garza Aldape’s demission have come in.
His resignation was accepted by Huerta in the friendliest
manner. He concluded the conversation, however,
by telling Aldape the <i lang="es">Espagne</i> was sailing on Monday,
and that he had better leave on Sunday morning, so as
to be sure not to miss it. This being late Saturday evening,
Garza Aldape demurred, saying his family had no
trunks. The President assured him that he himself
would see that he got all he needed. Subsequently he
sent Aldape a number of large and handsome receptacles.
Madame G. A. received a hand-bag with luxurious fittings,
and 20,000 francs <i lang="es">oro</i> in it! The “old man” has a
royal manner of doing things on some occasions; and
then again he becomes the Indian, inscrutable, unfathomable
to us, and violent and high-handed to his own
people—whom he knows so very well.</p>

<p>The reception at Chapultepec, yesterday, was most
interesting. As we drove through the Avenida de los
Insurgentes up the <i lang="es">Paseo</i> toward the “Hill of the Grasshopper”
the windows of the castle were a blaze of light
high up against the darkening sky.</p>

<p>On our last visit to Chapultepec,<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Madero and Pino
Suarez were there, and shades of the murdered ones began<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
to accost me as I appeared on the terrace. One of
the glittering presidential aides, however, sprang to give
me his arm, and in a moment I was passing into the
familiar <i lang="es">Salon de Embajadores</i>, to find Señora Huerta installed
on the equally familiar gilt-and-pink brocaded
sofa placed across the farther end. She has been a very
handsome woman, with fine eyes and brow, and has
now a quiet, dignified, and rather serious expression.
She was dressed in a tight-fitting princess gown of red
velvet, with white satin guimp and black <i lang="fr">glacé</i> kid gloves.
She has had thirteen children, most of whom seemed to
be present on this, their first appearance in an official
setting. The daughters, married and unmarried, and
their friends receiving with them, made quite a gathering
in themselves. As I looked around, after saluting
Señora Huerta, the big room seemed almost entirely
filled with small, thick-busted women, with black hair
parted on one side over low, heavy brows, and held
down by passementerie bandeaux; well-slippered, <em>very</em>
tiny feet, were much in evidence. None of the “aristocrats”
were there, but <i lang="es">el Cuerpo</i>, was out in full force.</p>

<p>The President came at about six o’clock, walking
quickly into the room as the national air was played, and
we all arose. It was the first time I had seen him. N.
presented me, and we three stood talking, in the middle
of the room, while everybody watched “America and
Mexico.”</p>

<p>Huerta is a short, broad-shouldered man of strong
Indian type, with an expression at once serious, amiable,
and penetrating; he has restless, vigilant eyes, screened
behind large glasses, and shows no signs of the much-talked-of
alcoholism. Instead, he looked like a total abstainer.
I was much impressed by a certain underlying
force whose momentum <em>may</em> carry him to recognition—now
the great end of all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span></p>

<p>I felt myself a bit “quivery” at the thought of the
war-cloud hanging over these people, and of how the man
dominating the assembly took his life in his hands at his
every appearance, and was apparently resolved to die
rather than cede one iota to <em>my</em> country. After the usual
greetings, “<i lang="es">a los pies de Vd. señora</i>” (“at your feet,
señora”), etc., he remarked, with a smile, that he was
sorry I should find things still a little strained on my
return, but that he hoped for a way out of the very natural
difficulties. I answered rather ambiguously, so far
as he is concerned, that I loved Mexico and didn’t want
to leave it. I felt my eyes fill over the potentialities of
the situation, whereupon he answered, as any gentleman,
anywhere in the world, might have done, that now that
<i lang="es">la señora</i> had returned things <em>might</em> be arranged! After
this he gave his arm to Madame Ortega, wife of the
Guatemalan minister, the ranking wife of the Spanish
minister being ill, and Madame Lefaivre not yet arrived.
Señor Ortega gave me his arm, and we all filed out into
the long, narrow gallery, <i lang="es">la Vitrina</i>, overlooking the city
and the wondrous valley, where an elaborate tea was
served. The President reached across the narrow table
to me to touch my glass of champagne, as the usual
<i lang="es">saludes</i> were beginning, and I found he was drinking to
the health of the “<i lang="es">Gran Nación del Norte</i>.” Could I do
less than answer “<i lang="es">Viva</i> Mexico”?</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp47" id="i_060fp" style="max-width: 40.625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_060fp.jpg" alt="V. Huerta">
</figure>

<p>After tea, music—the photograph fiends taking magnesium
snap-shots of Señora Huerta and the dark-browed
beauties clustering around, with an incidental head or
arm of some near-by diplomat. Madame Ortega then
got up to say good-by, and after making our adieux we
passed out on to the beautiful flower- and palm-planted
terrace. Again, in the dim light the memory of Madero
and Pino Suarez assailed me rather reproachfully.
It was a curious presentment of human destinies,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
played out on the stage of the mysterious valley of
Anahuac, which seems often a strange astral emanation
of a world, rather than actual hills and plains. A mysterious
correspondence between things seen and unseen
is always making itself felt, and now, in this space between
two destinies, I felt more than ever the fathomlessness
of events. Other “kings” were dead, and this
one could not “long live.”</p>

<p>Afterward we played bridge at Madame Simon’s with
the <i lang="es">chicheria</i> there assembled. It seemed very banal.
All the guests, however, turned their handsome faces and
rustled their handsome clothes as I entered, and in a
detached sort of way asked how it had all gone off—this,
the first official reception of <em>their</em> President.</p>

<p>To-day Congress opens, and N. does not attend. I
am glad, in the interests of the dove of peace, that we
went to the reception yesterday. The officials will realize
there is nothing personal in to-day’s absence.</p>

<p>Last night there was a pleasant dinner at the Cardens’,
who are now settled at the comfortable Legation. They
are very nice to us, but I feel that Sir L. is naturally
much chagrined at the unmeritedly adverse press comments
he has had in the United States. We all shivered
in our evening dresses, in spite of the rare joy of an
open fire in the long drawing-room. There is a thin,
penetrating, unsparing sort of chill in these November
evenings, in houses meant only for warm weather.
I should have enjoyed wearing my motor coat instead of
the gray-and-silver Worth dress.</p>

<p>The British cruiser squadron under Admiral Cradock
sailed last night for Vera Cruz, which is packed to overflowing
with people from here. The prices, “twelve
hours east and a mile and a half down,” are fabulous.
One woman, so her husband told me, pays ten dollars a
day at the Diligencias for a room separated only by a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
curtain from an electric pump, which goes day and
night.</p>

<p>Villa has made a formal declaration that, owing to Carranza’s
inactivity, he assumes the leadership of the rebellion,
which is the first, but very significant, hint of two
parties in the north: Huerta is very pleased, it appears,
and is looking forward to seeing them eat each other up
like the proverbial lions of the desert. A few “lost illusions”
will doubtless stalk the Washington streets and
knock at a door or two.</p>

<p>Well, another Sabbath has passed and we are still
here. Burnside is up from Vera Cruz. He says we
can’t back down, and war seems inevitable. It will
take the United States one hundred years to make
Mexico into what we call a civilized country, during
which process most of its magnetic charm will go. The
Spanish imprint left in the wonderful frame of Mexico
is among the beauties of the universe. Every pink belfry
against every blue hill reminds one of it; every fine old
façade, unexpectedly met as one turns a quiet street
corner; in fact, all the beauty in Mexico except that of
the natural world—is the Spaniards’ and the Indians’.
Poor Indians!</p>

<p>I have been reading accounts of the deportation of the
Yaquis from Sonora to Yucatan, the wordless horrors of
the march, the separation of families. I can’t go into
it now; it is one of the long-existent abuses that Madero,
at first, was eager to abate. Volumes could be written
about it. Another crying shame is the condition of the
prisons. Belem, here in town, is an old building erected
toward the end of the seventeenth century, and used as
an asylum of some kind ever since. Much flotsam and
jetsam has been washed up at its doors, though I don’t
know that the word “washed” is in any sense suitable.
When one thinks that a few hundred <i lang="es">pesos’</i> of bichloride<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
of lime and some formaldehyde gas would clean up the
vermin-infested corners and check the typhus epidemics,
one can scarcely refrain from taking the stuff there oneself.
It seems so simple, but it is all bound up so inextricably
with the general <i lang="fr">laisser-aller</i> of the nation. No
one is in Belem three days without contracting an itching
skin disease, and a large proportion of the prisoners
there, as well as at Santiago, near by, are political, journalists,
lawyers, <i lang="la">et al.</i>, who are used to some measure of
cleanliness. The <i lang="es">Penitenciaría</i> is their show prison,
built on modern principles, and compares favorably with
the best in the United States.</p>

<p>Yesterday we lunched with the Ösi-Sanz. He is an
agreeable, clever, musical Hungarian, married to a handsome
young Mexican, widow of an Iturbide. In their
charming rooms are many Maximilian souvenirs that he
has ferreted out here; big portraits of the emperor and
Carlota look down from the blue walls of the very artistic
<i lang="fr">salon</i>, and a large copy of the picture of the deputation
headed by Estrada, which went to Miramar to offer
Maximilian the imperial and fatal crown. Vitrines are
filled with Napoleon and Maximilian porcelain, and
they have some beautiful old Chinese vases. In the
viceregal days these were much prized, being brought
up from the Pacific coast on the backs of Indian
runners. Afterward, we had bridge at the Corcuera-Pimentels—another
smart young Mexican <i lang="fr">ménage</i>. Their
house, too, is charming, full of choice things, beautifully
and sparingly placed; the rooms would be lovely
anywhere. Then home, where I looked over that depressing
book, <cite>Barbarous Mexico</cite>.</p>

<p>In Huerta’s speech before Congress on the 20th, he
makes use of the famous words of Napoleon—“The law
is not violated if the country be saved.” We all wondered
how he fished it up!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span></p>

<p>There is a cartoon reproduced in <cite>The Literary Digest</cite>,
which I am sending you. In it Uncle Sam is saying to
President Wilson, “It’s no use, Woody; you can’t pet a
porcupine,” the porcupine being Huerta, in the background,
sitting near a bit of cactus. Some London
papers call Huerta the “Mexican Cromwell.” His
speech, putting patriotism and morality above expediency,
evidently made a hit.</p>

<p class="chapblock">“Decisive word” from Washington—A passing scare—Conscription’s
terrors—Thanksgiving—The rebel advance—Sir Christopher Cradock—Huerta’s
hospitable waste-paper basket.</p>


<h3><em>November 28th.</em></h3>

<p class="dropcap">An exciting day. The long-looked-for “decisive” word
came from Washington this morning, to be communicated
this evening to every embassy and legation
in Europe. By to-night all the foreign representatives
here and the press will be informed. It states that we
will not recede one step from our position; that Huerta
and all his supporters must go; that we will isolate him,
starve him out financially, morally, and physically;
that revolution and assassination may come to an end
in Latin America; that we will protect our interests and
the interests of all foreigners, and that peace must be
made in Mexico, or that we will make it ourselves!
It is the <i lang="la">argumentum ad hominem</i> certainly, and we can
only wait to see what acrobatic feats to avoid the blow
will be performed by Huerta. The language is unmistakable
and could only be used because the military
force necessary is behind it and ready.</p>


<h3><em>November 29th.</em></h3>

<p>Well, the scare of yesterday has passed....
Now the Foreign Office here can do more
masterly ignoring!</p>

<p>Last month, on the 25th, Huerta signed a decree
increasing the army to 150,000; the work of conscription<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
has been going on at a great rate. After the bull-fight
on Sunday seven hundred unfortunates were
seized, doubtless never to see their families again. Once
far from Mexico City, they are not bright about getting
back. At a big fire a few days ago nearly a thousand
were taken, many women among them, who are put to
work in the powder-mills. A friend told me this morning
that the father, mother, two brothers, and the sister
of one of her servants were taken last week. They
scarcely dare, any of them, to go out after dark. Posting
a letter may mean, literally, going to the cannon’s
mouth.</p>

<p>In “junking” the other day I found an interesting
old print of the taking of Chapultepec by the Americans,
September, 1847, which I have fitted into a nice old
frame. I am keeping it up-stairs. I went to the Red
Cross this morning for the first time since my return.
They all greeted me most cordially and said N. was
“<i lang="es">muy amigo de Mexico</i>” (“very much a friend of Mexico”).
I shall take Wednesdays and Saturdays for my
service.</p>

<p>To-morrow is Thanksgiving. I am receiving for the
Colony and such of the <i lang="fr">chers collègues</i> as care to help
wave the Stars and Stripes. It will be a sort of census
of how many Americans are really left in town. Their
number is fast dwindling.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Yesterday was a busy day. I went to mass at San
Lorenzo, where the nice American rector gave a very
good Thanksgiving sermon. I rarely go there, except
on some such occasion. It is far from the Embassy, and,
though once in the best residential part of the city, it
is now invaded by a squalid Indian and <i lang="es">mestizo</i> class.
With the exception of San Lorenzo, which is very clean
(the American church, as it is called), the churches in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
that quarter strike a most forlorn note, with their silent
belfries and dirt and general shabbiness.</p>

<p>About two hundred came to the reception yesterday,
and I only wish <em>all</em> had come. I really enjoyed shaking
those friendly hands. The times are uncertain, and ruin
for many is probable at any moment. The rooms were
filled with flowers; I had a nice buffet and a good,
<em>heady</em> punch. Elim was dressed in immaculate white.
He made one shining appearance, and then reappeared
ten minutes later, his radiance dimmed, having been
sprinkled accidentally by the nice Indian gardener.
He was reclad, but some over-enthusiastic compatriot
gave him a glass of punch, and the rest of the afternoon
I seemed to see little legs and feet in the air. The
<i lang="fr">chefs de mission</i> all came also, but of course it was an
American day, the beloved flag flying high and catching
the brilliant light in a most inspiring way.</p>

<p>Clarence Hay (John Hay’s son) is down here with
Professor Tozzer and his bride, for archæological work.
They first appeared on the horizon yesterday, the atmosphere
of a less harassed world still hanging around
them, and were most welcome. Tozzer is professor of
archæology at Harvard and has mapped out work here
until May, in connection with the Museo Nacional. The
Toltec and Aztec treasures still hidden in the earth
would repay any labor.</p>

<p>We fly up and down the <i lang="es">Paseo</i> constantly. I think
there is the fastest and most reckless motor-driving in
the world in Mexico, but some divinity is sleepless and
there are few accidents. Jesus, our chauffeur, is a gem
of good looks, neatness, willingness, competency, and skill.
When he is told to come back for us at half past eleven,
when we are dining out, and he has been on the go all
day, he not only says “good,” but “<em>very</em> good,” with a
flash of white teeth and dark eyes. The rest of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
servants are so-so. If I thought we were going to stay
I should change the first man. He ought to be the last,
as he is not only a fool, but an unwilling one. As it is
he who is supposed to stand between me and the world,
I am often maddened by him. He is Indian, with a dash
of Japanese, not a successful mixture in his case, though
he is <em>supposed</em> to be honest.</p>


<h3><em>November 29th.</em></h3>

<p>I haven’t taken a census of the inhabitants of the
house. Several of the women, I know, have children
living with them, but a little unknown face appeared at
a door yesterday, and was snatched back by some unidentified
hand. They don’t produce them all at once,
but gradually.</p>

<p>We had a white bull-terrier given us seven weeks
old, Juanita by name. It has threatened to rain dogs
here since it became known that we wanted <em>one</em>, but I
have avoided all but two since returning. Elim looks
sweet playing with her, two little milk-white young things.
But Juanita’s stock is low. She tries her teeth on anything
that is light-colored and soft, especially hats, and
faces now stiffen at her approach.</p>

<p>A bit of a domestic upheaval this morning. The Indian
butler with the dash of Japanese has been dismissed,
or, rather, has dismissed himself. His was a
case of total inefficiency and bad temper. I gave him a
recommendation, for, poor fellow, he had seen his best
days under the Stars and Stripes. The press-gang will
get him, and he will doubtless soon be on the way to the
north. I am to have a new butler on Monday.</p>


<h3><em>Later.</em></h3>

<p>I have just been going over the map with Captain
Burnside, and we have been tracing the slow and sure
advance of the rebels. They are down as far as San
Luis Potosí, not more than fourteen hours from here.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
They manage to isolate the Federal detachments, one
after the other, cutting the railroad lines in front and
in the rear. There is a good deal of that northern march
where one can go a hundred kilometers without finding
a drop of water.</p>

<p>I was reading Mme. Calderon de la Barca’s letters—1840-1842—last
night. She was the Scotch wife of the
first Spanish minister after the Mexican independence,
and her descriptions of political conditions would fit to-day
exactly, even the names of some of the generals repeating
themselves. She speaks of “the plan of the Federals,”
“the political regeneration of the Republic,”
“evils now arrived at such a height that the endeavors
of a few men no longer suffice,” “a long discussion in
Congress to-day on the granting of extraordinary powers
to the President,” “a possible sacking of the city.”...
Our history here. She goes on to say that they (the brigands)
are the growth of civil war. Sometimes in the
guise of insurgents taking an active part in the independence,
they have independently laid waste the country.
As expellers of the Spaniards these armed bands
infested the roads between Vera Cruz and the capital,
ruined all commerce, and without any particular inquiry
into political opinions robbed and murdered in all directions.
And she tells the <i lang="fr">bon mot</i> of a certain Mexican:
“Some years ago we gave forth cries—<i lang="es">gritos</i> (referring to
the Grito de Dolores of Hidalgo). That was in the infancy
of our independence. Now we begin to pronounce,
<i lang="es">pronunciamos</i> (a <i lang="es">pronunciamiento</i> is a revolution).
Heaven only knows when we shall be old enough to speak
plainly, so that people may know what we mean.”</p>


<h3><em>December 2d.</em></h3>

<p>I go in the afternoon to a charity sale at Mrs. Adams’s,
for the “Lady Cowdray Nursery Home.” Mr. A. is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
Cowdray representative of the huge oil interests in
Mexico. It sometimes looks as if this whole situation
could be summed up in the one word, “oil.” Mexico
is so endlessly, so tragically rich in the things that the
world covets. Certainly oil is the crux of the Anglo-American
situation. All the modern battle-ships will be
burning oil instead of coal—clean, smokeless, no more
of the horrors of stoking—and for England to have practically
an unlimited oil-fount in Mexico means much
to her.</p>

<p>We had a pleasant dinner last night here—Clarence
Hay, Mr. and Mrs. Tozzer, and Mr. Seeger; the dinner
itself only so-so. Mr. Seeger’s suggestion that the
<i lang="es">guajolote</i> had been plied with grape-juice rather than
with something more inspiring was borne out by the
bird’s toughness, and there were strange, unexplained
intervals. However I impressed upon C. H. that I was
giving him this splendid <i lang="es">fiesta</i> because his father had
signed N.’s first commission (to Copenhagen), and the
time passed merrily. There are other things you can do
at dinner besides eating, if you are put to it.</p>

<p>I inclose a long clipping, most interesting, from Mr.
Foster’s <cite>Diplomatic Memoirs</cite>. He was minister here
for some years—1873-1880, I think. His relations, too,
of conditions at that time seem a replica of these in our
time: “The railroad trains always contained one or
more cars loaded with armed soldiers. The Hacendados
did not venture off their estates without an armed guard
and the richest of them lived in the cities for safety.
Everybody armed to the teeth when traveling and the
bullion-trains coming from the mines were always heavily
protected by guards.” Mr. Foster sets forth the actions
of the United States in delaying recognition of Diaz when
he assumed the Presidency, and tells of the various moments
in which we were on the brink of war with Mexico.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
In 1875, Congress conferred on Diaz “extraordinary
faculties,” the effect of which was to suspend the
legislative power and make him a dictator.</p>

<p>N. paid over the Pius Fund, yesterday—the indemnity
of 45,000 pesos that Mexico is forced to pay yearly to
the Catholic Church in California for confiscation of its
property about one hundred years ago. It was the first
decision of the Hague Tribunal. Archbishop Riordan,
when consulted about the manner of paying it, telegraphed
to Mr. Bryan that he left it in N.’s hands
to be disposed of as if it were his own. N.’s policy
has been to get the various foreign powers to appeal to
us for protection of their citizens, thus tacitly acknowledging
our “Monroe” right to handle questions that
came up. So far France, Germany, Spain, and Japan
have done so.</p>


<h3><em>December 3d.</em></h3>

<p>Yesterday, at four o’clock, Sir Lionel and Sir Christopher
Cradock were announced. When I went down-stairs,
a few minutes later, I found my drawing-room a
blaze of afternoon sun, setting off to perfection twice
six feet or more of Royal British navy—Sir Christopher
and his aide, Cavendish, resplendent in full uniform.
They had just come from calling on Huerta in state, at
the Palace. I was really dazzled for the first moment.
Sir Christopher is a singularly handsome man, regular of
feature, and of distinguished bearing. His aide, equally
tall and slender, a younger silhouette of himself, was
standing by his side. Britannia <i lang="la">resplendens</i>! Sir Christopher
was evidently very interested in seeing, at first
hand, the situation he is to “observe” from the vantage
of Vera Cruz. After a lively half-hour he was borne off
by Sir L. for visits at the legations, and comparative
darkness fell upon the room. As we are all dining at the
German Legation, where there is a gala dinner for him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
and the captain of the <em>Bremen</em> and his staff, we merely
said <i lang="fr">au revoir</i>.</p>


<h3><em>December 4th.</em></h3>

<p>The dinner last night for twenty-four was most brilliant,
and perfectly appointed, from the lavish caviar
on beds of ice to the last flaming <i lang="fr">omelette en surprise</i>.
We sat at the small ends of the table, Madame Lefaivre
on von Hintze’s right, and I on his left; Sir Lionel by
me, and Sir Christopher by Madame Lefaivre; Lady
Carden, handsomely gowned and jeweled, at the other
extreme end, with the next ranking men on either side.
Sir C., just opposite to me, was glistening with decorations
and shining with the special, well-groomed, English
look. I asked him if he hadn’t been afraid to come
over the rebel-infested mountains with so much temptation
on his person. He answered, as a forceful, sporting
look came into his eyes, “They wouldn’t get the chance
to <em>keep</em> anything of mine!”<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>It is impossible to talk politics; things are too delicate
and I imagine we all have rather a shifty look in the eye
at the remotest mention of <i lang="es">la situación</i>. I can see,
however, that Sir C. has been impressed by Huerta, and
would probably have liked to tell him to “keep it up.”</p>

<p>I wore my filmy black and my pearls, which combination
seemed to give pleasure. After dinner, and some
conversation with the captain of the <em>Bremen</em>, who, however
great his merit, didn’t have the clothes nor the distinction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
of Sir C., we played bridge—Sir C., Lady Carden,
Hohler, and myself. Sir C. won every rubber in a
nice, quiet way. He lunches with us to-morrow at Chapultepec
restaurant; von Hintze and his officers, unfortunately,
are already engaged for a Colony lunch.</p>


<h3><em>Evening.</em></h3>

<p>A full day. Red Cross work from ten till twelve,
then home to change—not only my dress, but the scent
that hung round me—to go to Chapultepec. Sir C. and
Cavendish, somewhat dimmed by being in plain clothes,
drove up to the restaurant just as I was getting out of
the motor, the Belgian minister, Mr. Percival, and the
Cardens coming a few minutes later. We had espied
Huerta’s auto in the Park, and I had the bold idea of
getting the President for lunch, knowing it would render
things spicy for Sir C. Heaven was watching over me,
however, for instead of stopping at the restaurant for
one of the famous <i lang="es">copitas</i>, Huerta passed through the
Park, disappearing in the direction of Popotla.</p>

<p>It was ideal lunching on the veranda, bathed in the
warm, scented air, talking of many things, and climes,
with the easy exchange of thoughts that is the pleasure
of people of the world. Sir C. said that he had spent
most of his time changing his clothes, since his arrival,
having come with nothing between full uniform and
morning coat. He had been to the Foreign Office that
morning in uniform, into civilian for lunch, was to dress
at three for some sort of function at the Palace, and then
change to visit the castle of Chapultepec and the cadet
school attached. He had accomplished all these labors
when at six we met again at Madame Simon’s for bridge.
His roving seaman’s eye lighted up and seemed very
appreciative of the bevy of handsome young women he
found there. Again, with “Cradock’s luck,” he raked the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
shekels in. He said the visit to Chapultepec and the
cadet school was a most thorough proceeding, and that
he was spared no crack or cranny of the school, of which,
however, the Mexicans are justly proud.</p>

<p>There is a reception at the Legation for the English
colony to-night, and to-morrow early he descends to the
sea. Sir C. has distinguished himself in many climes
and will, I imagine, get a bit restless at Vera Cruz, waiting
for something to happen. He directed the British,
American, Japanese, and Italian forces for the relief of
Tientsin. He has yet to learn that no outside force can
hurry events in Latin America. They happen from their
own momentum, in their own way. I have an idea he is
a full-fledged Huertista, but, oh! so nice about it all.
He is ranking officer to Admiral Fletcher, which might,
at any moment, make complications. How can Britannia
rule the waves in the sacred territorial waters of
the Monroe doctrine? But it is always the same. On all
international occasions our admirals find themselves
outranked, even by navies of inferior powers. The
highest rank our officers on active duty can attain is
rear-admiral. They bring up the rear in more senses
than one, while all other forces have vice-admirals and
admirals available for any little trips that seem expedient.</p>


<h3><em>December 5th.</em></h3>

<p>I am sending this off by the German boat <em>Ypiranga</em>.
We have given up going to Vera Cruz on Saturday.
People say that it is impossible for us to do so without
creating a panic. No one would really know that we
had left a hostage in the shape of the blue-eyed boy. I
felt rather in the mood to go, after the visit of Sir Christopher,
who painted the harbor of Vera Cruz in most
attractive colors.</p>

<p>Huerta is gradually getting rid of his Cabinet. Garza<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
Aldape, Gobernación, went, as I wrote you, and now
de Lama (Hacienda) is to go to Paris by the <em>Ypiranga</em>.
I don’t imagine Huerta has much to do with his Cabinet.
They fill up certain conventional spaces usual in governments,
and that is all—a sort of administrative furniture,
along with the tables and chairs. Burnside said to-day
that when Huerta really has a Cabinet meeting it consists
of himself and advisers in the shape of <i lang="es">copitas</i>. He
has just got full powers from “Congress” to put into effect
any orders he may give in military and naval matters
for the next year. He pays no attention to Washington
and it is rather difficult to do anything with a person who
acts as if you were non-existent. The ultimata continue
to go into the waste-paper basket, and Vera Cruz
is so full of war-ships that those yet to come will have to
stay outside the harbor. The <em>Rhode Island</em>, the <em>Suffolk</em>,
and the <em>Condé</em> have the best places available for the big
ships. The rest of the harbor is taken up with gunboats.</p>

<p class="chapblock">Huerta visits the Jockey Club—Chihuahua falls—“The tragic ten days”—Exhibition
of gunnery in the public streets—Mexico’s “potential
Presidents”—“The Tiger of the North.”</p>


<h3><em>December 6th.</em></h3>

<p class="dropcap">The position here gets more curious every day.
Public opinion, as we understand it, is non-existent
in Mexico. It is always some despot who brings some
sort of order out of chaos by means unknown (though
they may be suspected) to the public, who judge his
worth entirely by the degree of peace and prosperity
that follows.</p>

<p>N. was sitting with some of the males of the “First
Families” of Mexico, in the Jockey Club, this morning,
when in sailed Huerta. He knew none of the <i lang="fr">jeunesse</i> or
<i lang="fr">viellesse dorée</i>. He stood looking around him for a moment,
blinking as he suddenly came into the light.
N. espied him, went over to him, and then made the necessary
presentations, Huerta hanging on his arm. After
the first shock of his entrance there was a rallying around
him. He doesn’t belong to the club, but that, of course,
doesn’t make any difference to him; he feels himself
President and superior in brain, will, and achievement.
N. ordered <i lang="es">copitas</i>, and the visit went off with the snap
peculiar to all of Huerta’s sorties. After all, he is their
President.</p>

<p>I send you a copy of <cite>Life</cite>, with an editorial on Mexico.
It remarks that, asking the Mexicans (13,000,000 being
Indians) to elect a President by constitutional methods<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
is “like asking the infant class to select a teacher.”
There is no doubt that our ways don’t yet fit them. It’s
like dressing sonny up in father’s clothes!</p>

<p>Another military train blown up. We were all hoping
that the rumored shortage in dynamite among the rebels
would make railway travel more attractive. Also stories
of mutilations that cause one to shiver.</p>

<p>The reason some of the newspapers give for the almost
groveling attitude of the Powers, and their acquiescence
in our exclusive tutelage in Mexico, is that, according to
international law, we will be responsible for the millions
they are losing, and that, at the appointed hour, they
intend to press Uncle Sam with the bill—the French, the
English, the Germans, and the Spaniards.</p>

<p>Lunch to-day at the French Legation. Very pleasant,
as always. I sat next to Corona, governor of the Federal
District, a handsome, highly colored, dark-eyed man
in the prime of life. His wife and daughter are in Paris.
There is such a sense of the transitoriness of the officials
in Mexico, here to-day and gone to-morrow, that intercourse
seems very bootless; the sword of Damocles is
not only hanging, but falling all the time. May was also
there, as pessimistic and politically wrought up as usual.</p>

<p>My big <i lang="fr">salon</i> begins to look very home-like. I have
some lovely lamps made of single, big, brass-and-silver
church candlesticks, many exquisite Ravell photographs
of this marvelous land finally fitted into good old frames.
I had the smart young Mexican set in for bridge to-day.
They were asked for five, which is a little early for them,
and they didn’t begin to arrive until six. Lovely young
women with beautiful jewels and dresses to set off their
dark beauty; Señora Bernal, Señora Amor, Señora Corcuera,
Duquesa de Huette (her husband is a handsome,
polo-playing Spaniard), Señora Cervantes, Señora Riba—two
or three of them <i lang="es">enceinte</i>, as is usual. They made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
the rooms quite radiant. The Mexican men are often
put in the shade by their handsome wives, who would be
lovely anywhere. The difficulties of bringing up young
boys here are, for obvious reasons, so great that both
Mexicans and foreigners send their sons away at an
early age. The men we know have most of them been
at school in England (Beaumont, or Stonyhurst); and
their English is as good as ours—sometimes better.
There is a sort of resigned irritation, veiled by perfect
courtesy and unfailing amiability, on the part of these
people toward our policy, which seems to them cruel,
stupid, and unwarranted. I can only hope it will soon
bear testimony to itself, for this close watching of the
means to an end—if it be an end—is very wearing.</p>


<h3><em>December 8th.</em></h3>

<p>A very nice letter came from Mr. Lind this morning.
He says that Villa boasts he will eat his dinner at the
Jockey Club, and he thinks there may be something in it,
adding that if it had not been for the progress of the rebels
he would have gone home. Chihuahua is in their
hands now, and their military man is installed in the
house formerly occupied by the Federal governor of the
state.</p>

<p>Last night I had a long talk with Burnside and Ryan
after dinner. There is a general expectancy of a <i lang="es">cuartelazo</i>
(revolution in the barracks) on the 10th. The troops
are paid every ten days, and this will be the second pay-day
to be passed over, unless Huerta can raise the necessary
millions before that time. Many influences besides
the United States are at work to make things uncertain;
sedition is rife, and the work of the press-gang is so constant
that the <i lang="es">peons</i> do not dare to leave their homes or
their holes to go to work.</p>

<p>Revolutions are not convenient, either for those who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
watch or for those who participate. The hegira of
natives and foreigners continues. The Mexicans who
can get away are, without doubt, thankful “there <em>is</em> no
place like home.”</p>

<p>I can’t agree that the foreign representatives could
be, at any time, in real peril. Huerta, Carranza, Zapata,
Villa, <em>or</em> the intervening United States troops would see
to it that not a diplomatic hair was touched. I can
imagine us all tightly housed in the <i lang="es">Palacio</i>, with our
infants and our jewels, the rest of our belongings gone
forever. Dr. R. is for having every woman and child
leave Mexico City, things have come to such a pass. I
know <em>one</em> who won’t go!</p>

<p>N. is thinking of telegraphing to Washington to ask to
have a few marines sent up from one of the war-ships, <i lang="fr">en
civil</i>, of course. We could lodge them easily down-stairs.
The losing of material things does not disturb me. When
the bad day comes we will be occupied with life and
honor. “<i lang="es">Todo por la patria</i>” (“all for one’s country”),
which reminds me of the story of Huerta’s parting with
a one-time Minister of War, and one of the various men
supposed to have witnessed Madero’s death. (Another
distinction is, that in six weeks’ office he was able to
amass a fortune of some millions, quite a record.) The
President told him, at a dinner, casually, that it might be
better for his health to leave next day for Paris. He
cried, “Impossible!” The upshot, of course, was that
Huerta saw him off at the station at the appointed hour,
saying, as he embraced him: “<i lang="es">Todo por la patria, mi
General!</i>” whereupon the victim, not to be outdone, repeated
in his turn: “<i lang="es">Todo por la patria, mi General!</i>”</p>

<p>People have curious stories to tell of the “tragic ten
days,” among them little ways of handling the machine-guns.
Ryan came across a group of men who were hovering
about one of the <i lang="fr">mitrailleuses</i>, and the man in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
charge obligingly started it off, to show them how it
worked—shooting down the street in the direction in
which it <em>happened</em> to be turned. Rather debonair! Mr.
Seeger tells the tale of asking a man at a gun who his <i lang="es">jefe</i>
was—Huertista, Maderista, Felicista? He answered,
“I don’t know.” He saw him, a moment afterward,
turn the gun around and shoot toward the opposite barricade.
Enemy or friend, it was all the same to <em>that</em>
“man behind the gun!”</p>


<h3><em>December 7th.</em></h3>

<p>I was at Tacubaya this morning, to see the operation
and cure for tuberculosis of a strange Brazilian, a
Dr. Botelho. Rows of emaciated Indians, stripped to
the waist, were lying or sitting in the sun. The operation
is a painless injection of hydrogen gas into the lung,
compressing it so that microbes, as my lay mind understands
it, don’t get the space they need to develop. As
the patients lay about they seemed to me like exotic
vegetation, ready to drop to earth, rot, and spring up
again. Strange Indian seed!</p>

<p>After Mass I found Colonel and Mrs. Hayes (the former
a son of ex-President Hayes), waiting to see us. They
are here for a few days only. I have asked them to dine
with us to-morrow evening.</p>

<p>The foreign Powers used to think that, though extremely
annoying, our Monroe doctrine was respectable.
Now they seem inclined to think it is an excuse for monopolizing
the New World for our own benefit. We may
come into Mexico with glory. Can we get out with
credit and not too high a bill? A letter from General
Wisser (you remember him, from Berlin) came just now,
written “In Camp, Texas City.” It had taken a little
matter of two months to get here. It is not impossible
I may welcome him to Mexico City.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span></p>


<h3><em>December 9th.</em></h3>

<p>The aftermath of that reception at Chapultepec has
begun to come in. Among many letters, one from an
ex-army officer says <em>he</em> would have “thrown the wine
into Huerta’s face.” All the newspapers mention the incident,
but with the empire tottering we saw no reason to
unduly precipitate matters by boycotting Mme. Huerta’s
reception, nor for being morose and brutal when there.
I wonder what would have happened if any of the
various fools, writing to protest, had been running
matters?</p>

<p>One of the New York newspapers prints a long editorial
headed “O’Shaughnessy,” saying President Wilson is fortunate
in having had the services of Mr. O’S. during the
diplomatic negotiations with Mexico. It presents the
matter as I would like, and winds up by saying that the
history of Mexican-American diplomacy, to be complete,
would need more than one chapter headed “O’Shaughnessy.”</p>

<p>The dinner for Colonel and Mrs. Hayes was rather
amusing, though the food was horrid and everything was
cold <em>except</em> the champagne. After dinner the visit of
two potential Presidents of Mexico (they are always being
drawn to the Embassy like steel to the magnet of
recognition) gave a decided touch of local color to the
scene. A large, handsome, alert man, of the flashy type—Zerafino
Dominguez—came first. His battle-cry and
banner is “Land for the landless, and men for the men-less
lands”—a good, sound, agricultural cry with everything
in it, if it could only come true. “<i lang="es">El apostol del
maiz</i>,” as he sometimes is called, is a wealthy landowner
and scientific farmer, who contends that Mexico needs
more <em>corn</em> rather than more <em>politics</em>—and never was a
truer word spoken. He has within the last few days,
however, given up his presidential pretensions to a friend<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
who came in later, with the same desire of the moth for
the star.</p>

<p>The shape of the friend’s head, however—narrow across
the forehead and terminating in a high peak—would
prevent his getting any votes from <em>me</em>. The pale young
son of the hearty Dominguez was also there. I offered
them cigarettes and <i lang="es">copitas</i>; the latter they did not
accept. Burnside said it was to prove they hadn’t the
weaknesses of Huerta. I thought they might be afraid
to drink, remembering afterward that none of us had
offered to partake with them of the possibly poisoned
draught. They sang the praises of the great and beautiful
<i lang="es">Estados Unidos del Norte</i> till we were quite embarrassed.
Incidentally “ze American womans” came in
for a share of admiration. I wonder shall we be giving
Huerta asylum some day?</p>


<h3><em>December 11th.</em></h3>

<p>Yesterday I was too busy to write; spent the morning
at the Red Cross, and then had luncheon at Coyoacan, at
Mrs. Beck’s charming old house. Coyoacan is the most
interesting, as well as livable, of all the suburbs, with its
beautiful gardens and massive live-oaks shading the
streets. Cortés made Coyoacan his stamping-ground,
and one lovely old Spanish edifice after the other recalls
his romantic history.</p>

<p>From here he launched his final assault against Mexico
City; here poor, noble Guauhtémoc (I have an old
print representing him with his feet in boiling water and
an expression of complete detachment on his face) was
tortured, in vain, to make him reveal the hiding-place
of Montezuma’s treasure. After leaving Mrs. B.’s, Mrs.
Kilvert and I went for a stroll in the garden of the celebrated
Casa de Alvarado, built by him, of the famous leap.
An old <i lang="es">servidor</i> of Mrs. Nuttall’s, to whom the house now
belongs, opened the gate for us, with a welcoming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
smile. We passed through the <i lang="es">patio</i>, in one corner of
which is the old well (with a dark history connected with
the murder of the wife of one of the Conquerors), out
into the garden with its melancholy and mysterious
charm. The possession of the house is supposed to bring
bad luck to the possessors, and sudden and violent
death has happened to a dweller there even in my time.
Roses and heliotrope and the brilliant <i lang="es">drapeaux Espagnoles</i>,
with their streaks of red and yellow, were running
riot, and a eucalyptus-tree drooped over all. In this
magic land, even a few months of neglect will transform
the best-kept garden into some enchanted close of story.</p>

<p>As I was getting out of the auto in front of the Embassy,
I found sitting on the curb a pitiful family of five—four
children of from seven years to eighteen months,
and the mother, who was about to have another child.
The father had been taken by the press-gang in the morning,
and they were in the streets. I gave the woman some
money, and one of the maids brought out bread and cake,
and a bundle of garments for the children. Such bright-eyed
little girls, real misery not having pinched them
yet. I speak of them because they typify thousands of
cases. A hand on his shoulder, and the father is gone
forever! Such acts, occurring daily, estrange possible
sympathy for the government. The woman will return
to me when the money is spent.</p>

<p>There are Federal rumors of a split between Villa and
Carranza, but, though they will inevitably fight, I don’t
think the time is ripe for it, and they are some five hundred
kilometers apart, which makes for patience and
charity. Villa, whose latest name is the “Tiger of the
North,” has made such daring and successful military
moves that Carranza must put up with him. He has
just married again, during the sacking of Torreon (a
detail, of course, as was also his appearance at a ball in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
<i lang="la">puris naturalibus</i>—a shock to the guests, even in revolutionary
Mexico!)</p>

<p>I only heard at luncheon at the Russian Legation that
Count Peretti, <i lang="fr">conseiller</i> of the French embassy in
Washington, is leaving for Paris to-night, by the <em>Navarre</em>.
He married when <i lang="fr">en poste</i> here a handsome Mexican
wife. This letter goes with him. On Saturday we
dine at Lady Carden’s. The dinner is given for Colonel
Gage, the handsome and agreeable British military
<i lang="fr">attaché à cheval</i> between Washington and Mexico City.</p>

<p>The fight around Tampico continues, the town being
indeed “between the <em>devils</em> and the deep sea.” No one
yet knows the outcome, except that the unoffending
blood of the Mexican <i lang="es">peon</i> is reddening the soil. The
<em>Kronprinzessin Cecilie</em> is down there to take off refugees;
also the <em>Logican</em>, and we are sending the <em>Tacoma</em> and the
<em>Wheeling</em>. I understand that, though some hundreds
have been taken on board, about five hundred unfortunates
are still waiting on the pier in the neutral zone.</p>

<p>I must begin to arrange my Christmas tree for the
few friends remaining in this restless, distant land, with
some little gift for each.</p>


<h3><em>December 12th.</em></h3>

<p>To-day is the Feast of the Virgin of Guadalupe, the
patroness of Mexico and of all the <i lang="es">Lupes</i>. For the
last few days the mysterious Indian world has been
hurrying to the shrine from far and near. I went out
there this morning with dear Madame Lefaivre and Mr.
de Soto. The crowd was immense, the same types, costumes,
habits, language, gestures, even, that Cortés
found on his arrival, unmodified (and unmodifiable,
which Washington cannot understand) by four hundred
years of surrounding civilization. Our motor gliding
along the straight road was quite out of the note and
picture. Many of the Indians were doing the distance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
between the city and Guadalupe, several kilometers, <em>on
their knees</em>, with bowed heads and folded hands. Madame
Lefaivre found it <i lang="fr">très-beau</i>, but was glad that no
voice told her that to save her soul, or, what is more
important, her Paul’s soul, she would have to do likewise.</p>

<p>The plaza before the church was thronged with a
brightly clad, motley crowd, venders of all sorts predominating,
mostly selling candles and votive offerings
of strange kinds. Hundreds of <i lang="es">tortilleras</i> were sitting on
their haunches before their primitive braziers, piles of
dough (<i lang="es">masa</i>, they call it) in their laps, molding the
<i lang="es">tortillas</i> with a slapping noise of the palms—an old,
inherited gesture, and pinching them into shape with
their slender, graceful fingers. The church itself, as we
pressed in, was crowded to suffocation, almost every one
holding a candle of some length and thickness. The
high altar was a blaze of light, the celebrated image
above visible to all. It is the famous <i lang="es">Imagen de la Virgen</i>,
stamped miraculously on the <i lang="es">tilma</i> (coarse cloth mantle)
of a lowly Indian, Juan Diego, as the Virgin appeared to
him passing the rock of Tepeyac on his way to Tlaltelolco,
to receive instructions in the mysteries of the Faith.
The sacred image is placed above the high altar in a
gold frame, and there is a gleaming, solid silver stair-railing
leading up both sides.</p>

<p>In the middle aisle were double files of young Indian
girls, with bright-colored scarfs about their shoulders,
and strange, high, picturesque-looking head-dresses, of
gaudy tissue-paper, with trimmings of gold. They were
chanting monotonous minor songs, accompanied by a
swaying, dance-like movement of the hips—all most reverent.
They had been there for hours and showed no
sign of leaving. I hope I said a reverent prayer, but I
felt a bit cheap in contrast to the rapt devotion on all
sides. I was glad to get a breath of fresh air in the plaza,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
or rather, “fresher,” as it was almost as crowded as the
church, and every dog in Mexico seemed to be there,
scratching and shaking itself.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_086fp" style="max-width: 40.625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_086fp.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center">VILLA DE GUADALUPE</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We made our way, Mr. de Soto clearing a path for us,
to the Capilla del Pocito. These waters are said to have
gushed from under the feet of the Virgin as she appeared
to Juan Diego. <i lang="fr">A la</i> the fountain of Trevi, whoever
drinks of it returns to Mexico. We didn’t drink, for
various reasons unconnected with return. The Indians
use it for healing purposes and a lively trade in brightly
painted, earthen-ware bottles, in which to carry the
water away, was going on about the chapel. The Indians
come, sometimes a many days’ journey, on foot,
of course, and when they arrive they bivouac all about
the church as if they had reached “home.” What with
babies crying, beggars begging—“<i lang="es">por la Virgen</i>,” “<i lang="es">por
la Santa Madre de Dios</i>”—dogs yapping and venders
hawking, the whole dominated by the acrid smell of the
various pungent messes they roll up in their <i lang="es">tortillas</i>, it
was, indeed, Indian life at its flood. They must have presented
much the same scene when they gathered to receive
instruction and baptism from the old friars.</p>

<p>The “Aztec wheels” (merry-go-rounds) and all kinds
of games of chance, to which they are addicted, help to
get the centavos out of the Indian pocket; but it is
their greatest holiday, this journey to their “Virgen India
de Tepeyac,” and they count no cost of fatigue and
savings. I only hope the press-gang will abstain to-day
from doing any of its deadly work of separating families.
You remember I once did a novena out there with
Señora Madero, praying for graces that Heaven did not
grant.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we went to the Reforma Club, the
British country club, where Sir Lionel and Lady Carden
were to present the prizes for the contests. Señora<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
Huerta, always dignified and quiet, sat between Lady C.
and myself. She had a married daughter with her, high-chested
and thick-lipped, clad in a changeable green-and-red
surah silk and a hat with bedraggled pink feathers.
Señora Huerta herself wore black velvet, with touches of
white in the wrong places. She has, I imagine, natural
taste in dress, but must first learn. She has seen much
of life. So many children and a soldier husband always
starting for some seat of war, and now at last President
of “glorious, gory Mexico,” means that few of the
human experiences are foreign to her. I must say I have
a great esteem for her. The President was not well—<i lang="es">el
estómago</i>. Of course every one jumps to the conclusion
that he had been consorting too freely with his friends
Martell and Hennessy. It isn’t given to <em>him</em> to have a
simple indigestion! Afterward we left cards at the houses
of various <i lang="es">Lupes</i>.</p>


<h3><em>December 13th.</em></h3>

<p>I feel ill at the news this morning. The Federals seem
to have taken many positions from the horrible rebels;
and the fratricidal war will take on a new strength without
hope of issue on either side. I feel the cruelty and the
uselessness of our policy more and more every day.
The “fine idealism” does not prevent the inhabitants
from being exterminated. Why don’t we come in?
Or—hands off, and give Huerta a chance!</p>

<p>The Mexicans have never governed themselves, and
there is no reason to suppose they can till a part of the
eighty-six per cent. that can’t read have at least learned to
spell out a few words. The much vaunted and pledged
rights of man, voting and abiding by the results, are
unknown and, as long as Mexico is Mexico, unknowable.
So why lose time in that search for the impossible?
The rebels seem to be able to take the towns, but not to
<em>hold</em> them. Once in the various strategical positions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
they are in the same plight as the Federals; and so the
see-saw continues, with no results except horrors beyond
words. I am tempted to hope for intervention
(unnecessary though it once was), no matter what the
cost.</p>

<p>There are so many plays and puns and doggerels on
the inviting name of O’Shaughnessy. One Shamus
O’S. says he won’t admit the man in Mexico who bears
the Frenchy name of <i lang="fr">chargé d’affaires</i> to the family!
However, why worry? The last viceroy bore the noble
name of Juan O’Donoju! Another calls N. the man that
put the “O” in Mexico. And they do love a head-line:
“Hugged by Huerta”; or “Is it not better to be kissed
than kicked when you deliver the periodical ultimatum?”
Of such slender things fame is made.</p>


<h3><em>December 14th.</em></h3>

<p>My poor woman with the four children returned yesterday,
having got to the end of the money I gave her
a few days ago. They didn’t look quite as prosperous (?)
as they did the first time I saw them. The mother asked
for five dollars for a fruit license and two dollars to get
the fruit. I gave it to her, whereupon she knelt down
in the street, baby in arms, the three other little girls
following suit, and asked for my blessing. When I put
my hand on her head I felt the tears come to my eyes.
I suddenly saw in <em>one</em> woman all the misfortunes of the
women of this land, separation, destitution, ravishments,—all
the horrors flesh is heir to.</p>

<p>In the evening we dined at the British Legation.
Colonel Gage is most agreeable and brought a lot of
outside news. Like all military visitors, I suppose he
is hoping to happen on a “scrap.”</p>

<p>Am waiting for the auto. Elim and I go out to the
del Rios’ garden at Tlalpam for a picnic; the del Rios
are in Europe. The day is heavenly beyond compare<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
and the Ajusco hills (in which the Zapatistas operate)
are soft and blue in the near distance. We all miss Mr.
James Brown Potter very much. He was the witty,
unfailing life of all those picnics of my first Mexican
visit.</p>

<p>Villa has just set up a somewhat uncertain dictatorship
in Chihuahua, in which state he, so to speak,
graduated in banditry. He began his public killing
career <em>not</em> too badly, according to the story, by shooting
a man for seducing his sister. It was probably the best
act of his life. He is now in the prime of life and “ready
for anything.” Even in Diaz days, Villa was a proscribed
bandit; but with a few followers, well-mounted
and knowing every trail and water-hole in the country,
he was uncatchable. He subsequently went over to
Madero. The women flee the towns that he and his
men enter. I suppose there is no crime that he has not
committed, no brutality toward wounded, sick, and
prisoners and women. With it all, he may be the
heaven-born general that some assert, but God help
Mexico if he is! In Chihuahua, Luis Terrazas, one of
the nephews of Enrique Creel (who was ambassador to
Washington, Minister for Foreign Affairs, etc.), is being
held for five hundred thousand dollars ransom. Mr. C.
came to see N. the other day, looking very much put out.
N. thought he perhaps reflected that five hundred thousand
dollars was a large sum, and was wondering if it
was worth it.</p>

<p>However, it is always convenient to suppose that
people held for ransom will get along all right, even if
the money isn’t forthcoming. N. promised Mr. C. that
through the most <em>in</em>direct of channels he would have it
brought to Villa’s attention that he’d better be careful
on account of unfavorable impressions in the United
States. One wonders and wonders where Villa, Aguilar,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
Zapata, and all the brigands get their endless guns and
ammunition. Of course the foreign Powers think we
supply it or let it be supplied.</p>

<p>Intervention in Mexico is an accomplished fact, it
would almost seem, though not a shot has been fired
by us. And what is done cannot be undone.</p>

<h3><em>December 14th.</em></h3>

<p class="dropcap">This evening, as I was coming through the <i lang="es">Zocalo</i>
motoring home from the Country Club, I found the
<i lang="es">Palacio</i> decked out in the national colors, to celebrate the
<i lang="es">clausura</i> of the <i lang="es">Camara</i>, which will not open until April 1,
1914. Huerta has all extraordinary powers vested in
himself, and is going to run the whole “shooting-match.”
Thick <i lang="fr">défilés</i> of carriages and autos, full of richly dressed
people, were on both sides of San Francisco, the most
brilliantly, extravagantly lighted street I know. The
Embassy motor was allowed to run quickly between the
two lines. The town seemed so animated and prosperous
that one can’t realize the horrors underneath.</p>

<p>The <i lang="es">cantinas</i> have been closed on Sunday for several
months—a wise act of Urrutia, then Minister of Gobernación.
The people thus buy food, instead of <i lang="es">pulque</i>, on
the Sabbath, and can work on Monday—<i lang="es">San Lunes</i>, as
the first, often idle, day of the week is called. The <i lang="es">pulquerías</i>,
with their sickening, sour smell, abound in all the
poorer quarters, and are distinguished, besides the smell,
by fringes of many-colored tissue-paper hanging from the
tops of the doors. Their names—<i lang="es">El amor divino</i>, <i lang="es">Hija
del Mar</i>, <i lang="es">El Templo de Venus</i>, etc., seem to be enticing.</p>

<p>The Italian minister, Cambiaggio, is “biding a wee”
in Havana, having been stopped by his government....<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
It is the question, always recurring, of not having a new
minister arrive who, by presenting his credentials, places
another stone in the Huerta arch....</p>

<p>The confidential report of Admiral Cradock to <em>his</em>
government was filched by the press. The typewriter
who made the copy was paid $200 for it. In it, it appears,
he quotes Nelson as saying that the “most sacred
international relationship in the world is that between
England and the United States.” Most annoying for
Sir Christopher!</p>


<h3><em>December 15th.</em></h3>

<p>Many of the American statesmen seem to be giving
opinions on the Mexican situation. Mr. Choate, at a
dinner in New York, asks, “What most agitates the
hearts of Americans to-day? It is Mexico,” and then
goes on to say, “There is but one thing for us to do—trust
the President, and stand by him.” Andrew D.
White doesn’t approve of the Administration’s policy
and thinks we are drifting into war, “Which,” he continues,
“is a better thing for the generals who bring it
to a successful finish than for those who bring it on—Lincoln
being the great exception.”</p>

<p>The Spaniards in Chihuahua (some four or five hundred)
are having a dreadful time. The Villista order
gives them ten hours in which to get out of the town;
and now, as I write, that long caravan of weak and strong,
old and young, fit and unfit, is wending its way, on foot,
through the immense desert of Chihuahua toward Torreon—425
miles. The nights are icy cold and there are
stretches of 90 miles without water; and hostile bands are
ready to attack at any moment. The confiscated property
will amount to millions, as the Spaniards own nearly
all the mercantile establishments, as well as the upper-class
homes. Villa is quoted as saying that he would like
to kill every <i lang="es">gachupin</i> (Spaniard born in Mexico) <em>and</em><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
his offspring. No one knows when the march and assault
on Monterey, a rich old city on a hill and not easy
to take, will begin. I hear that the Spaniards there want
to come <i lang="fr">en masse</i> to Mexico City, also leaving everything.
They know they will have no quarter at Villa’s
hands.</p>

<p>The Spaniards are the traders of Mexico. They keep
the countless pawn-shops (<i lang="es">empeños</i>); they are the
usurers and money-lenders of all kinds; they are the
overseers on the <i lang="es">haciendas</i> and, incidentally, they keep
all the grocery-shops; in fact, they control the sale of
nearly everything in Mexico. The Spanish minister
(with the Irish name of Cologan), whose handsome wife
was born in Vera Cruz, has just been here. His life is
one huge burden, and the collective troubles of Mexico
are laid at our broad doors.</p>

<p>D’Antin leaves to-night for Vera Cruz, to take with
him Dr. Silva (ex-governor of Michoacan), who, to tell
the truth, has not voluntarily resigned, which is the
reason he needs safe-conduct. Silva was at one time a
faithful adherent of Huerta. He is to board a Spanish
ship sailing at twelve to-morrow.</p>


<h3><em>December 16th.</em></h3>

<p>Last night, after dinner, Burnside and Dr. Ryan took
the map to see what route the unfortunate Spaniards of
Chihuahua could have followed. It seems scarcely credible,
with the frontier and hospitality nearly one-half
nearer, that they should have chosen the terrible march
through the desert and over the mountains to Torreon,
which, at any time, may again fall into Villa’s hands. He
<em>would</em> be in a rage to find he had to bother a second time
with the <em>same</em> set of unfortunates! They say their route
is strewn with valuables that they started out with and
little by little were obliged to abandon. Isn’t the picture
appalling?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span></p>

<p>Von Hintze has just spent an hour here; he is always,
like the others, advocating the mediation of The Hague,
saying it would be a way out of <em>our</em> dilemma, and an issue
out for Huerta. Is he on the track of something that
may be of service to both sides? In Washington a couple
of weeks ago it was suggested from some source (probably
Brussels) that the matter should be so submitted—<em>both</em>
sides, however, resenting it. Von Hintze brought me
a dainty, gold-headed cane to replace his handsome
Chinese stick that was supposed, unjustly, to have disappeared
under the protection of the Stars and Stripes,
on Thanksgiving Day. I made up my mind to get that
cane, and I subsequently found it, accidentally, standing
near the unused umbrella-stand at the Norwegian Legation,
where he had left it himself that same day. The
innocent was, for once, rewarded. Von Hintze is always
very fair-minded and impersonal in political matters, and
doesn’t lose his head when the political compass veers
as wildly as it does here. He is a good friend, too, I
think, and there may be something in the Hague suggestion.
We may, at any day, see another faction start
up; the victor of Torreon, Juarez, and Chihuahua will
not care to lay his victories at Carranza’s feet. One man
after another outshines his chief, commits treason,
comes to power, and falls to make way for some one else,
generally a one-time friend. As the clever editor of the
<cite>Mexican Herald</cite> dryly remarked, “A traitor in Mexico
seems to be any one that doesn’t hold office.”</p>

<p>The Zapatistas are getting very active again, fighting
hard at Milpa Alta, in the Ajusco hills near here. Some
were seen at Tlalpam and Xochimilco (Tlalpam is where
we often go on Sundays). Sometimes on the road to the
Country Club or Tlalpam one hears the shooting.</p>

<p>All is quiet again at Tampico, though the dead are yet
lying about unburied. The rebels got far into the town,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
but did very little damage to property. They wanted,
people think, to get hold of a lot of the rolling stock of
the railway. Tampico is a horrible, flat, mosquito-infested,
malarial place, but it can give to the navies of
the world the motive power that they want. It is the
focus of the <i lang="fr">guerre des pétroles</i>. Is it really true that oil
is at the back of all these tragedies?</p>

<p>At the dinner at the British Legation on Saturday
there was an Englishman, a Mr. Graham, who has a place
near Durango. He told, as an eye-witness, the story I
had heard before, of one of the rebel chiefs seizing the
aged and saintly archbishop Mendoza while at the altar,
forcing him to walk two miles over stubble fields, in the
heat of the day, then putting him in a damp and filthy
cell, two feet by six. Mr. Graham gave a bond for
$15,000, and he was got out. This is but one of a
thousand stories to the shame of the rebels.</p>


<h3><em>December 17th.</em></h3>

<p>Villa has finished the confiscation of the huge Terrazas
estates in Chihuahua. We hear that the wife of the
American consul, Mrs. Letcher, is among the refugees
at El Paso. The Terrazas estates include palatial residences
in the city of Chihuahua, banks, mines, lands,
cattle, etc. Luis Terrazas is now a refugee in the United
States. His sister, known as the “Angel of Chihuahua,”
by reason of her endless charities, married Mr. Creel, former
Ambassador to Washington. It is Mr. Terrazas’s
eldest son who is held against a 500,000 pesos’ ransom,
having been taken forcibly from the British Vice-Consulate.</p>

<p>Yesterday the run on the Banco Nacional and the
Banco de Londres y Mexico for the exchange of certain
bank-notes, no longer good, was enormous. Many shops
are hanging out signs that notes of Chihuahua, Coahuila,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
Querétaro, Guanajuato, etc., will not be accepted
from customers. The richer refugees coming in from
Chihuahua had hundreds of thousands of such. Oh, for
a few wicked <i lang="es">cientificos</i>!</p>

<p>A lot of trouble about the Constitutionalist fiat money
is beginning in the north. Merchants who fight shy of it
are put into jail, regardless of nationality. Its appearance,
to a careful, thrifty man, must be appalling. Bills
have only one signature, and any one holding them forges
the missing signatures, or the nearest and most interested
<i lang="es">jefe politico</i> affixes the stamp of his <i lang="es">jefatura</i>. The
drawback is that it is difficult to get merchandise or food
in exchange. When is money not money? That way
lies economic ruin.</p>

<p>Huerta talks a good deal about Napoleon these days—“<i lang="es">gran
hombre, gran hombre!</i>” (“a great man! a great
man!”). In a recent speech he said: “We have a right
to our independence, and we will keep it. If any attack
is made against the country, all will witness something
great and extraordinary.” Villa, Carranza, Huerta
(Zapata, too, the chance offered), delight in ignoring the
United States. On that point, <em>all</em> are united. The recovery
of Torreon has had immense, though, of course,
only temporary, economic importance. The huge cotton
crop which Villa picked when <em>he</em> took the town, pressing
into service every man, woman, and child, and thinking
to sell it to the United States, has been shipped by the
Federals to various cotton-mills, and means work for
thousands.</p>

<p>There are sometimes really bright things in the <cite>Mexican
Herald</cite>. To-day, about the United States protection
of citizens, it says: “Mr. Bryan’s idea of protection
seems to be built on the <em>cafetería</em> plan—come and get
it. We don’t carry it to you.”</p>

<p>Cambiaggio, the new Italian minister, will be detained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
indefinitely in Havana, Italian affairs in the mean
while being in the hands of the British. I wonder how
long the foreign Powers will be willing to wait and watch.
What they say about our policy when N. and I are not
present is probably not according to the protocol!</p>


<h3><em>December 17th.</em></h3>

<p>Another reception is to be held at Chapultepec this
afternoon. I keep thinking of the four incumbents who
have lived and breathed and had their being there since
we arrived—Diaz, de la Barra, Madero, and Huerta.
With the exception of the first two, each lived in a separate
society. The members of one don’t spill over
into the other. At Señora Huerta’s reception there was
not a face, except those of the <i lang="fr">chers collègues</i>, that I had
ever seen there before—no homogeneity, no <i lang="fr">esprit de
corps</i>. “<i lang="es">No me gusta</i>” (“I don’t like it”) seems a sufficient
reason for not standing by the administration,
whatever it may be.</p>

<p>It is strange how little trace is left of those who have
lived there, suffered, and grown great. There is scarcely
a Maximilian souvenir or a Diaz <i lang="es">recuerdo</i>, not a thing
of de la Barra, nor any vestige of Madero, except his
<i lang="es">planchette</i> and his library, consisting of vegetarian and
spiritualistic literature, which confronts Doña Carmen
Diaz’s collection of works of piety. Of course there is
nothing of Huerta; his shadow has scarcely even darkened
it. It was planned in a most extravagant way in
1783 by one of the viceroys, Galvez, who had the beautiful,
white-skinned, red-haired bride. It was unoccupied
during many revolutionary years, then refitted for Maximilian.
Later Diaz used it as his summer residence. Poor
Madero lived there during the sixteen months of his incumbency,
and I remember him pacing up and down
the terrace in that robin-egg-blue vest of his, with a visionary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
but indestructible smile on his honest face; really
mentally, as well as bodily, lifted above all the realities
of life.</p>

<p>The “Hill of the Grasshopper” has always had a habitation
on it. Montezuma lived there, “king and gentleman,”
and many of the old ahuehuetes<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> are supposed to
be contemporaneous with him. At any rate, the view
that entrances my eyes is the same that his looked on.
The whole valley stretches out before one, fringed by
those lovely mountains. Sunsets, sometimes in golden
tones and sometimes in silver, flood the valley, giving the
white points of the volcanoes the most dazzling effects of
light imaginable; and then there are luminous enchantments,
dissolving distances, an intermingling crystalline
blue and rose. How can I express its beauty! People
say the light is more wonderful in Greece, but this is my
“high light.” Even in the afternoons of the rainy season,
when the clouds are banked high, there is always an iridescence
to the grays—gray with red or blue or yellow
or violet in it—never the dull tones of our rain-clouds.</p>


<h3><em>December 18th.</em></h3>

<p>Just back from a <i lang="es">gira</i> in the city. Immense crowds
around the Banco Central. This is the clearing-house
for all the state banks, and each person waiting outside
had state bank-notes to exchange against those more
attractive ones of the Banco Nacional.</p>

<p>I see Cardinal Rampolla is dead. I thought of his magnificent
appearances in St. Peter’s, that tall and slender
form, that proud and beautiful profile, the head held
high—a fit frame on which to hang the gorgeous vestments.
I remember the disappointment of our various
friends when Austria vetoed his election at the last conclave.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
I wish he might have had it; but now that he has
passed through the door I would not call him (nor any
one) back. The old Roman days came so vividly to
my mind—and many besides Rampolla who are no
more.</p>

<p>Elim is sitting by me, writing in two colors all the
words he knows—<i lang="de">Gott</i>, <i lang="de">kuss</i>, <i lang="fr">bonnemaman</i>, <em>papa</em>, <em>mama</em>.
He has just asked “Who handed me down from the clouds
when I was born?”</p>

<p>I am giving a luncheon at the Chapultepec restaurant
on Friday for Colonel Gage and the Cardens.</p>

<p>The Mexican papers take great pleasure in likening
Woodrow Wilson to Napoleon III., with comparisons of
the Mexican policy and Sedan!</p>

<p>The reception yesterday did not have the snap and go
of the first. We got there about six, going in almost immediately
to tea, spread, as usual, in the long gallery. I
stood at the table between von Hintze and Hedry, the
Austrian <i lang="fr">chargé</i>.</p>

<p>It seemed to me, as I looked around the table, that
each minister had some strange, battered-looking female
by him. They proved to be the wives of Cabinet Ministers,
who change so fast that it is impossible to keep
track of their better halves, produced only on this single
occasion. Moheno, however, was able to produce a
very pretty wife, smartly dressed, with magnificent
pear-shaped emeralds dangling from her white ears,
and a most lovely young daughter.</p>

<p>The President was preoccupied and vague, drank no
healths, and his frock-coat seemed longer and looser than
ever; indeed, the servants had just begun to pour
the champagne when, his wine untasted, Huerta gave
his arm to Mme. Lefaivre, with a gesture of putting the
function behind him, and, the banquet almost untouched,
we all filed out behind him. He was evidently terribly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
bored and thinking of other things. And, anyway, he
isn’t the man to conduct things twice in the same way.
He stopped as he was leaving the <i lang="fr">salon</i> and told me he
had <i lang="es">muchas muy buenas cosas</i> (many good things) to say
of N. “Only good things, <em>even</em> in my absence.” With
that, he left the festive scene and the affair rather fell to
pieces. N. had a dinner at the club for Colonel Gage,
who was at the reception in morning coat. He had purposely
not brought his uniform, being wary at touching
the official note, which might re-echo too loudly in
Washington.</p>

<p>I went to the Simons’, who were having a dinner for
the captain of the <em>Condé</em> and his staff lieutenant. They
were big, good-looking Frenchmen, who had been at the
reception in all their glory of gold braid and decorations.
Through a motor trip and a punctured tire they had
missed the audience arranged for them by their minister
with Huerta, and to atone they had gone looking especially
official.</p>

<p>Yesterday I went out to see Mother Semple at the
American Convent of the Visitation. Until two years
ago she had had a large and flourishing school at Tepexpam.
There came a Zapatista scare, thirty or forty
bandits dancing around the convent one night, shooting
off pistols and screaming out ribaldries. Fortunately
nothing precious was broken, but the nuns were ruined, as
the parents withdrew their little darlings. Now they
are trying to get the school together again in a house at
Tacubaya, which, though very picturesque, with an
old garden and a sunny <i lang="es">patio</i>, is not at all suited to the
double purpose of community life and school. They
have dreams of selling the big property at Tepexpam for
a barracks. The government may get the barracks
in these days of taking what one sees, but I doubt if
the nuns will ever get the money.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span></p>


<h3><em>December 19th.</em></h3>

<p>Mexican calls all the afternoon. Mme. Bernal has a
really lovely house, just done over, full of choice things.
She herself is young and beautiful, in a dark-eyed, white-teethed,
pallid way. Then I went to see Mercedes del
Campo, whom I found, with her baby and an Indian
nurse, in the palm- and eucalyptus-planted garden. She,
like all the others, is young and handsome. Her husband
was in the diplomatic service under Diaz, but since then
has fought shy of the administration set. It’s a pity, as
he would be an ornament to any service. Such beautiful
English—such perfect French!</p>

<p>They are living in the house of their aunt, Madame
Escandon, in the Puente de Alvarado, the street named
after this most dashing of Cortés’ captains. It was near
by that he made his famous leap in the retreat of the
Noche Triste; the “dismal night,” when the Indians, witnessing
his apparently miraculous escape, thought him a
god. A little farther up from the Escandon house is the
celebrated Palacio Bazaine or Casa de la Media Luna.
It was presented, with all its luxurious furnishings, by
the Emperor to Marshal Bazaine, on the day of his
splendid nuptials with a beautiful Mexican. Here the
Emperor and Carlota were often received, and it became
the center of the fashionable life of the time. There are
many stories of the extravagant and almost regal entertaining
that went on there. Now all these splendors are,
indeed, gone up in smoke; the stately mansion is a cigarette-factory.
I never pass it without a thought of
Maximilian and the “<i lang="es">Ya es hora</i>” of the guard who
threw open the prison door of the Capuchin Convent in
Querétaro on that fatal morning, and of Bazaine’s saddest
of all sad ends.</p>

<p>The luncheon for Colonel Gage, who returns to Washington
next week, went off very snappily. When I got<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
to Chapultepec I found all my guests assembled on the
veranda. I excused my lateness by saying that I had
been waiting for N., who was with the President. “But
the President is here!” they all cried. I said, “I wonder
if he would lunch with us.” They all looked aghast, but
delighted at my boldness.</p>

<p>I then saw Huerta approaching us through the large
hall toward the veranda, with the governor of the
Federal district, Corona, and a pale, dissipated, clever
man—for the moment (which I imagine he is making
golden) Minister of Communicaciones. I went forward
with some <i lang="fr">élan</i>, as to a charge, and invited the
President to the <i lang="es">fiesta</i>. That small Indian hand of
his waved very cordially. It is literally the velvet
hand, whatever violent deeds it may have done. But
he said that he had a junta of much importance; he
would be delighted to accept another time, and so on.
There was more shaking of velvet hands, and we went
back to our expectant guests, who were decidedly disappointed.
It was very pleasant, as always, on the
broad veranda, looking toward the Castle, visible above
the great branches of the century-old ahuehuetes.</p>

<p>N. had been driving with the President for an hour
before lunch, and had asked him for the release of three
Americans, long imprisoned here. Huerta assured him
that they should all be set free, whether guilty or not, just
to please him; and at six o’clock this evening the first
instalment arrived at the Embassy, delivered into N.’s
hands by two Federal officers. And so the work goes on.
Huerta is very <i lang="fr">prime-sautier</i>. Once before when N. had
asked for the punishment of some soldiers, convicted of
deeds of violence against some Americans, he responded
promptly: “Who are they? Where are they? They shall
all be killed!” N. protested, aghast at the possibly innocent
untried sheep suffering with the guilty goats.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
Anything, however, to please N. in particular and the
United States in general. There is really nothing that
the United States couldn’t do with Huerta if they would.
All concessions, all claims, pending through decades,
could be satisfactorily adjusted. As it is, Huerta keeps
on at his own gait, not allowing himself to be rushed or
hustled by the more definite energy of the <i lang="es">Republica del
Norte</i>, playing the game of masterly inaction and scoring,
for the time being, on Washington. After all, you don’t
get any “forwarder” by waving copies of the constitution
in a dictator’s face. He ignores his relations with
the United States, never mentioned us in his speech to
Congress, and probably put the ultimatum into the
waste-paper basket. I am beginning to think that, in
the elegant phrasing of my native land, he is “some”
dictator! The New York <cite>Sun</cite> speaks admiringly of the
way in which he continues to treat Mr. O’Shaughnessy
with a friendly and delicate consideration.</p>


<h3><em>December 20th.</em></h3>

<p>Red Cross all the morning. It is wonderful, the stoicism
of the Indian, where pain, hard pain, is concerned.
A rather amusing incident occurred to-day. I asked a
man who had had his hand shot off if it were a “Zapatista,”
“Constitucionalista,” or “Huertista” deed. He
raised the other paw to his forehead, answering with great
exactitude, “No, señora, Vasquista.” I thought the
Vasquista movement had long since died the usual unnatural
death.</p>

<p>I see that the new Austrian minister to Mexico has
arrived in the United States <i lang="fr">en route</i> for his post, and the
new Italian minister arrives at Vera Cruz to-morrow,
after a wait of three weeks at Havana, for “<em>our</em> health,”
not his. As is the custom, some one from the protocol
has gone to meet him and bring him up to the city. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
European Powers evidently mean to carry out their
program independent of “watchful waiting.” It will
be rather hard on our government when two more
representatives of great nations present their credentials
to the “Dictator.”</p>

<p>People say it is a pity that Huerta did not, on assuming
power, declare formally that he would have a dictatorship
for two years, until such time as the country was
pacified, leaving out entirely any question of elections.
However, that is “hindsight.” Apropos of Villa, I see
one of the United States papers chirps: “Is a new sun
rising in Mexico?” I have seen several rise and set on
the reddest horizon imaginable, in my short Mexican
day. As a butcher Villa cannot possibly be surpassed.
But “who loves the sword shall perish by the sword,” is
always true here. I spent the morning at the Red Cross,
washing and bandaging dirty, forlorn Aztecs. This year
they have the beds made according to our ideas. Last
year they used the blankets next the body and the sheet
on top—it “looked better.”</p>

<p>Calls and card-leaving all the afternoon, with Mme.
Lefaivre, fortunately. We generally do the “bores and
chores” together, chatting between addresses. Now it
is half past nine. I am looking over one of Gamboa’s
books. He was Minister for Foreign Affairs last August
when Mr. Lind arrived, and drafted the famous and entirely
creditable answer to “Mr. Confidential Agent.”
He is sometimes called the Zola of Mexico.</p>


<h3><em>December 21st.</em></h3>

<p>Just home from Mass. I go to the Sagrado Corazon
near by, built mostly with money given by the <i lang="es">muy
piadoso</i> Lascurain, a man of the highest integrity and
large personal fortune. For a long time he was Minister<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
for Foreign Affairs, and for twenty minutes (as I wrote
you), President, between Madero and Huerta.</p>

<p>I am now writing, veiled and gloved, waiting for the
picnickers to assemble here. About ten or twelve of us
are going to Mme. Bonilla’s lovely garden in Tacubaya.</p>


<h3><em>Evening.</em></h3>

<p>We had a peaceful <i lang="es">dia de campo</i> in the old garden, the
strange Mexican magic making beautiful things more
beautiful and transfiguring all that is ordinary. Mme.
B., an Englishwoman and, incidentally, a <i lang="la">cordon bleu</i>,
was sitting under a yellow rose-bush when we got there—looking
very attractive in white lace and beating up
the sort of sauce you make yourself, if you can, or go
without, in Mexico. We partook of an excellent combined
luncheon—we all brought something—under an
arbor of honeysuckle and roses, with true Mexican lack
of hurry. Afterward we strolled over the near hillside
in its garb of maguey and pepper trees. The volcanoes
looked inexpressibly white and beautiful in their aloofness
from our troubles, though the hills at their base are
the stamping-grounds of hordes of Zapatistas, and often
the smoke of fires indicates their exact whereabouts.
With true Anglo-Saxon disregard of native warnings,
we sat for a long time under a large pepper-tree, <i lang="es">arbol de
Peru</i>, which, the Indians say, gives headache, unable to
take our eyes from the soft outline of the city, swimming
in the warm afternoon light. Countless domes and
church spires were cut softly into the haze, the lake of
Texcoco was a plaque of silver far beyond, and above all
were the matchless volcanoes. To complete the first
plan of the picture, an old Indian, a <i lang="es">tlachiquero</i>, was
quietly drawing the juice from some near-by maguey
plants, after the fashion of centuries, with a sort of
gourd-like instrument which he worked by sucking in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
some primitive but practical fashion. It looks to the
uninitiated as if the Indian were drinking it, but its final
destination is a pigskin slung athwart his back. After
tea in the garden, on which a mystical blue light had
fallen, we motored home in the quickly falling dusk,
the thin, chilly air penetrating us like a knife.</p>

<p>Advices have come that the rebels are again attacking
Tampico. They evidently got what they wanted at
the last attack—four cartloads of dynamite and lots of
rolling stock, and are in a position to give a tidy bit of
testimony as to the value of the Constitutionalist principles.</p>

<p>Zapata had a narrow escape the day before yesterday.
He was surprised by Federals at Nenapepa, as he and
his followers were sitting around their camp-fire. He
barely escaped in the skirmish, leaving behind him his
precious hat, a big, black, Charro hat, wide-brimmed and
pointed crown, loaded with silver trimmings. It was
brought to town by Colonel Gutierrez, greatly chagrined
because he could not also bring what had been <em>under</em> the
hat. The image of Zapata on his charger, dashing
through fields of maguey, up and down <i lang="es">barrancas</i>, is very
characteristic of the brigand life so much the thing in
Mexico just now.</p>

<p>The new loan of 20,000,000 pesos has been underwritten
by a lot of foreign bankers, principally French,
I think, though some in New York are supposed to be
“involved.” It will keep things going for another couple
of months or so, and then the “sorrows of Huerta” will
begin again. As it is, he can continue for that length of
time to play with the kindergarten class at Washington.
A nice cable came from Mr. Bryan saying that the State
Department was much gratified at N.’s being able to
procure the release of the American prisoners I mentioned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span></p>


<h3><em>December 24th.</em></h3>

<p>The banks here have been given legal holidays from
the 22d of this month to the 2d of January. That is
<em>one</em> way of solving the banking problem. It is supposed
to be for the safeguarding of the depositors, who, however,
are crowding the streets leading to the closed
banks, wild to get <em>out</em> what they put <em>in</em>, to confide it to
the more trust-inspiring stocking.</p>

<p>To-day is Huerta’s saint’s day, <i lang="es">Sanctus Victorianus</i>.
There was a reception of the gentlemen of the Diplomatic
Corps at the Palace. The doyen made an address dealing
in safe but pleasant generalities, and Huerta replied,
protesting that he had but one idea, the pacification of
Mexico. The German minister is away to investigate
the murder of one of his nationals.</p>

<p>I again visited the tuberculosis hospital this morning
and was interested to see patients risen from the dead,
so to speak, and walking once more with the living. The
climate here is ideal for cures. I took some Christmas
packages to the Red Cross, then went to the Alameda.
On three sides of the Park the Christmas booths are set
out—<i lang="es">puestos</i>, they are called. The Indians bring their
beautiful and fragile potteries from long distances, and
endless varieties of baskets and toys, and last, but not
least, their relatives, so that family life in all its details
can be studied. They are selling, cooking, dressing,
saying rosaries, examining little black heads for the
ever-present visitants—a familiar Mexican occupation
at all seasons. The smell of Christmas trees and greens,
banked along the street, mingles with odors of peanuts
and peppers, <i lang="es">enchiladas</i>, and all sorts of pungent foods.</p>

<p>The <i lang="es">cohetes</i> are going off as I write. They are noisy
crackers, making sounds like rifle-fire. Their use is an
old custom that is observed for the nine days before
Christmas; but in these troublous days one is led to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
think rather of pistols than of the advent of the “Son
of Peace.”</p>

<p>A very nice letter came from Admiral Cradock, saying
that he has just got back to Vera Cruz from the
Tampico fray, the sojourn enlivened by some “good
tarpon-fishing.” He will not be able to return here for
Christmas, as he intended, but hopes we will soon run
down to Vera Cruz and be dined and saluted by him on
the <em>Suffolk</em>.</p>

<p>There are a thousand things to do about Christmas.
We trimmed the tree last night and it is locked away
in the big <i lang="fr">salon</i>, presumably safe from infant eyes.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">La Noche Buena</span>, <em>Christmas, 1913</em>.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">These Christmas hours I have been dwelling on
memories of my precious brother on his bed of
pain throughout these days last year, his <i lang="de">Tod und Verklärung</i>....
But I would call no one back, once through
“the door.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The tree was a great success—though in the morning,
when Feliz was hanging the last festoons of green about
the room, he crashed down, step-ladder and all, on the
side where the toys were piled. There had to be swift
runnings down-town to repair the damage. I was so
annoyed that I didn’t even ask if he were hurt, and he
seemed too aghast at the occurrence to feel any pain.
It was very pleasant to have the small remnant of the
faithful under one roof. The children played with their
toys and we grown-ups exchanged our little offerings
and greetings and everything seemed very cozy and safe—just
as if we weren’t “riding a revolution.”</p>

<p>Clarence Hay brought N. a bottle of cognac, inscribed:
“Nelson from Victoriano,” and a like-sized bottle of
grape-juice: “Nelson from W. J. B.” I leave you to
guess which we opened.</p>

<p>After the departure of the families, a few of the lone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
ones stayed—Seeger, Clarence H., Ryan—and we talked
until a late hour of the strange adventures we are all
living through in this land of endless possibilities.</p>

<p>To-day, after Mass, we drove to the beautiful little
Automobile Club, where Seeger gave a luncheon for us,
the Tozzers, Clarence Hay, and the Evans. The club is
built in the new part of the Park, on the edge of one of
the little artificial lakes made when Limantour laid out
the Park as it now is. We sat on the terrace toward the
high hill of the castle, which breaks the round horizon
of the magic hills. The air was soft, yet bright, the
moss-hung old ahuehuetes, symbols of grief and mourning,
had joyous, burnished, filmy outlines, and the
volcanoes were flinging white clouds about their lovely
heads. It was one of God’s own days—as days here
usually are.</p>


<h3><em>December 26th.</em></h3>

<p>I am sending you a few <cite>Heralds</cite>, with their Christmas(?)
head-lines: “Vera Cruz Rebels Suffer Defeat in Fierce
Fight”; “Rebels Ordered to Execute All Prisoners”;
“Town of Tapono Burnt to Ground by Federals”;
“Only Twelve Killed when Military Train Dynamited”;
“Fierce Fighting at Concepcion del Oro.” They
make one feel that “watchful waiting” in Washington
bids fair to be <em>woeful</em> waiting south of the Rio
Grande.</p>

<p>Elim was worn out by the Christmas festivities and
was dreadfully naughty. The season of <i lang="es">piñatas</i> is on,
and he has a great number of invitations—unfortunately.
At the <i lang="es">piñatas</i> a large, grotesque head and figure, dressed
in tissue-paper and tinsel, depending from the ceiling,
is the center of attention. The dress conceals a
huge, but fragile, earthern jar (<i lang="es">olla</i>) filled with nuts,
fruits, candies, and small toys. Each child is blindfolded
and allowed to have a whack at it with a big stick.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
When it is finally broken the contents spill everywhere
and are scrambled for. It seems a messy sort of game,
but it is time-hallowed here.</p>

<p>I sent Mr. Lind a telegram yesterday: “Affectionate
greetings; best wishes.” He might as well, or better,
be in Minneapolis. Nobody ever speaks of him and Vera
Cruz is like the grave as far as the government here is
concerned. Mexico is going to her downfall, and it
seems as if she must be nearly there. It is very sad to
us, who are on the ground. I never witnessed, before,
the strangling of a country, and it is a horrible sight.
The new Chilian <i lang="fr">chargé</i> came in a day or two ago: he
has been in Central America for twenty years, and says
this is his thirty-second revolution.</p>

<p>I caught sight of Mr. Creel-Terrazas in his carriage,
yesterday. His face was sunk and ashen, and he was
huddled up in one corner of the coupé, changed indeed
from the hale, rosy, white-haired man of a few weeks
ago. He and his family have lost everything at the
hands of the rebels. The family owned nearly the whole
of Chihuahua, and though stories—probably true—are
told of how, generations ago, they came into possession
of the vast property, driving the Indians from their
holdings into the desert, it does not change the present
fact that they are ruined, and the country with them;
the “judgment” upon them, if judgment it be, involving
countless others.</p>

<p>The whole question up there seems to reduce itself
very simply to a matter of grabbing from those in possession
by those desirous of possession. We are all waiting
for the inevitable falling out of Carranza and Villa.
The hero in any Mexican drama is never more than a
few months removed from being the villain. The actors
alone change; never the horrid plot of blood, treachery,
and devastation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span></p>

<p>You saw that de la Barra actually reached Tokio.
I was sure he would, having a way of finishing what
he begins. Five sets of ambassadors have been appointed
to set out for Japan to return the nation’s
thanks for the special embassy sent to the splendid
1910 <i lang="es">Centenario</i>—that apogee of Mexico’s national and
international life. The last two were the murdered
Gustavo Madero, who couldn’t tear himself away because
of the golden harvests to be reaped at home; and
Felix Diaz, because of his political aspirations.</p>

<p>You remember de la Barra, from Paris, an agreeable,
adroit man of the world, who proved himself, during
the five months that he was President <i lang="la">ad interim</i>,
a very good tight-rope walker on a decidedly slack
rope. The country was still enjoying the Diaz prestige,
and he found himself pretty generally acceptable to both
the old and the new régime. He has always been very
catholic. He became, later, rather a source of anxiety
to Madero, who feared his popularity, though his success
at the time was largely a matter of allowing all
really important questions to stand over for his successor.
Looking back on it all now, I see him in a very favorable
light: a careful, hard-working, skilful politician, with a
taste for peace and order which is not always inherent
in the Mexican breast, and a safe man to fall back on to
conduct the affairs of his country with dignity. When
in doubt, “take” de la Barra.</p>

<p>The <i lang="es">mañana</i> (to-morrow) game is the best played
down here; it is never actually subversive; and, as exemplified
by Huerta’s attitude <i lang="fr">vis-à-vis</i> the United States,
it is very effective against a nation that wants things
done, and done at once. I find that the Mexicans are
constantly studying us, which is more than we do in
regard to them. They look upon us as something immensely
powerful, that is able and, perhaps, if displeased,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
willing, to crush them. They are infinitely more subtle
than we, and their efforts tend more to keeping out of
our clutches than to imitating us. Our institutions, all
our ways of procedure, are endlessly wearisome to them,
and correspond to nothing they consider profitable and
agreeable. <i lang="la">Suum cuique</i>.</p>

<p>I have discovered that there are five Spanish phrases
quite sufficient for all uses, in the length and breadth of
this fair land: “<i lang="es">Mañana</i>” (“to-morrow”). “<i lang="es">Quién sabe?</i>”
(“who knows?”). “<i lang="es">No hay</i>” (“there isn’t any”). “<i lang="es">No
le hace</i>” (“it doesn’t matter”). “<i lang="es">Ya se fué</i>” (“he has
gone”). This last I add as, whenever any one tries to
get hold of anybody, “<i lang="es">Ya se fué</i>” is the answer. I have
given this small but complete phrase-book to many, who
find it meets almost any situation or exigency.</p>

<p>No news from Mr. Lind for some time. Doubtless
Christmas, as spent on the Mexican coast, alternating
damp heat and north winds, is a poor affair compared
with the <i lang="de">tannenbaums</i> and skating and general cheer of
<em>both</em> his Fatherlands. Some Western editor suggests that,
on his return, he will be in a position to publish a “comprehensive
blank book” on the Mexican situation. I
have broken many a lance for him; but when one of
the foreign ministers said to me yesterday, “your Scandinavian
friend is anti-Latin, anti-British and anti-Catholic,”
I could but retire from the field of
battle.</p>

<p>Elim is always followed by his two dogs—Micko, the
melancholy Irish terrier, and Juanita. The white bull
pup becomes more destructive and demonstrative every
day. Yesterday when she seemed not quite her awful
self one of the servants suggested hanging a string of
lemons around her neck. I remember having seen disconsolate
dogs wearing necklaces of lemons, but thought
children had placed them there. It appears, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
that such a necklace is in high favor among the Indians
as a cure for distemper.</p>

<p>I hear that the government intends to lease the Tehuantepec
Railroad to Pearson’s Oil Company for
twenty-five years, for 25,000,000 pesos. Huerta is depicted
in one of the papers as knocking at the European
pawnshop with the Isthmus under his arm.</p>


<h3><em>December 29th.</em></h3>

<p>I inclose a delightful letter from Mrs. J. W. Foster,
who always keeps so apace with events. Of course the
Fosters read the Mexican news with interest and understanding,
as they were here during the years Diaz was
trying to establish himself in spite of the Mexican people,
and not in spite of <em>us</em> as well, fortunately for Diaz and
them....</p>

<p>I send a cartoon from <cite>Novedades</cite>, representing Huerta
paralyzed. One nurse asks the other how he is, and she
answers: “No change. He can’t move yet.”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp57" id="i_116" style="max-width: 40.625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_116.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center">PARALYZED</p>

<p class="center">“HOW IS HE?”<br>

“NO CHANGE, HE CAN’T MOVE YET.”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Well, some one has got to “move” if this country
and all national and foreign interests are to be saved.
I cannot see that a new revolutionary party in the
north, whose sole virtue, up to now, is that it is “agin”
the government, can do it. Besides which it represents
only another pack of hungry wolves to be let loose upon
the country. I hear that Carranza has a brother, Jesus,
who possesses the family vice of greed to a great degree,
and is about to “operate” on the Isthmus. There are
predictions that it will look as though the locusts had
been over it, if he really gets a “chance.”</p>

<p>Four clerks are sleeping in the house, and the work is
going on apace. Cambiaggo, the new Italian minister,
was received yesterday with all honors emphasized. Oh,
that <i lang="it">Fata Morgana</i> of recognition! The Belgian minister
has got his leave and has just been here to say good-by.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
He has already the European eye so familiar to
those left behind. He has had a very cordial telegram
from a big banker in New York, and wondered if the
banker expected to put him up. I said, “If you are
met by an automobile and servants in New York, you
can be pretty sure you are to stay with him; otherwise
you’d better rough it at the Ritz.”</p>

<p>Various ideas are advanced by diplomats here as to
the possibility of some arrangement being made through
a third party, some one of the great Powers; ... some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
way by which the elections could really be held, and
Huerta, if really elected, allowed to remain. N. can’t
do it, nor Mr. Lind, nor any American. The national
pride on both sides is too compromised to admit of anything
but a third power stepping in and “doing the
trick.”</p>

<p>There is talk of a big English loan, guaranteed by the
customs, at the same time allowing a certain amount
of these to be freed—a couple of millions of pesos a month
for the expenses of the government. There is a general
twitching of international fingers, a longing to remedy
our bungling. May, with his face toward Europe, sees
everything rose-colored. He predicts that we shall be
here until the next elections, the first Sunday in July.
There is a great deal of speculation as to Huerta’s personal
fortune, but no one knows whether he is rich or
poor. His new house in San Cosme is, I hear, a cheap
affair. Mme. Huerta wore, when she received, one large,
very magnificent diamond depending from her throat.
But why shouldn’t she have it?</p>


<h3><em>Evening.</em></h3>

<p>No political excitements these last days; only a monotonous
and horrid record of grab by the temporarily
strong from the always weak. A “good deed” in
Chihuahua is one that transfers any valuable property
to a rebel. Those palatial residences, the homes of prosperity
and wealth for generations, have all changed
hands during the last three weeks, which, however, does
not mean that the much-talked-of <i lang="es">peon</i> has benefited
in the slightest degree. It simply means that a few men,
some of whom can neither read nor write, now hold
what used to be in the possession of a few men who <em>could</em>
read and write. The land in Mexico has always been in
the hands of a few thousand individuals, and the <i lang="es">peon</i> is
always exploited, no matter what the battle-cry. A kind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
paternalism on the part of some of the upper class <i lang="es">hacendados</i>,
who leave him more or less to the mercies of
the Spanish <i lang="es">administrador</i>, has been his best fate.</p>

<p>His unfitness for government has never been questioned.
When he is weak, he promises all things; when
he is strong, he is destructive. Though there have
been sentimental remarks about the peon’s intelligence,
and his wrongs, which <em>are</em> appalling, no government except
ours ever dreamed of putting the destinies of the
state into his hands—into the hands of these eighty-six
per cent. of human beings who can neither read nor
write.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, it is the custom to assert that the
Church kept the Indians in this state of ignorance; but
education, after the Laws of Reform in 1857, was taken
out of the hands of the priests and given into those of
the lay authorities. That was nearly sixty years ago—three
Indian generations. Who runs may <em>read</em>, literally,
in this case.</p>

<p>Eduardo I. told me an amusing and enlightening
story yesterday. An Indian went to a priest to ask to
be married. The priest, finding his ideas of the Divinity
were of the haziest in spite of much instruction, said,
“<i lang="es">Hijo</i>” (son), “I cannot do it until you have learned
<i lang="es">el rezo</i>” (a very elemental catechism), and proceeded to
give him further instruction. The Indian returned the
next day and said that it was all very difficult and that
he still did not understand about God being everywhere.
“Is He in the church?” “Yes.” “Is He in the <i lang="es">milpa</i>”
(cornfield)? “Yes.” “Is He in my hut?” “Yes.”
“Is He in the <i lang="es">corral de la casa de mi comadre</i>” (yard
of my godmother’s house)? “Of course; He is always
there,” said the priest. The Indian’s expression became
triumphant. “<i lang="es">Padrecito</i>,” he said, “I have caught you.
My <i lang="es">comadre’s</i> house has no yard!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span></p>


<h3><em>Evening.</em></h3>

<p>Mr. Lind is hurrying aboard the U. S. S. <em>Chester</em> to
meet the President at Pass Christian. Strong Carranzista
though Mr. Lind is proving himself, I don’t think
the President will be led into the risky policy of recognizing
this undeveloped but certainly not very promising
quantity. We can put in any sort of government in
Mexico—but can we <em>keep</em> one in? We encouraged the
powers of dissolution around Diaz, recognizing and aiding
Madero. The world knows the result. History always
repeats itself here, and the writing on the wall is
always in blood. After Mr. Lind’s months of inaction
it must seem good to be plowing the high seas <i lang="fr">en route</i>
to the weighty conference. He said he would have returned
to the States some time ago but for the “very
satisfactory” progress of the rebels. He was especially
“bucked up” when Villa announced his intention of eating
his New-Year’s dinner at the Jockey Club.</p>


<h3><em>December 31, 1914.</em></h3>

<p>Many people are still coming and going in the house,
but I am alone, thinking of New-Year’s eves of the past.
Now I must let this year, with its griefs, harassments,
glories, and interests slip into the next with this last
word for you. May we all be folded in the Eternal
Love. I think of my precious brother and his rare gifts.
I sometimes had the feeling of receiving through his
beautiful mind something direct from the universal reservoir
of thought.</p>

<h3><em>January 1, 1914.</em></h3>

<p class="dropcap">My first word goes to you. You know my heart, and
all my love and hopes.</p>

<p>A letter came from Mr. Lind, who is to-day at Pass
Christian. It was sent before he started. He wants
N. to come down to confer when he returns.</p>


<h3><em>Later.</em></h3>

<p>The President received the ministers at the Palace
this morning and in the afternoon Señora Huerta receives
at Chapultepec. I have people for dinner also.
The President’s answer to the Spanish minister’s speech
at the Palace was long and disconnected, with, however,
the insistent refrain that he had but one idea—the
pacification of Mexico, which he would and could accomplish
if given time. The German minister wasn’t
there. He was off investigating the murder of a German
subject in the interior.</p>

<p>Huerta appeared at the New-Year’s eve ball at the
Country Club—a most unusual stage-setting for him.
As soon as he saw N. he joined him and gave him one
of the <i lang="es">abrazos</i> they so enjoy hearing about in the
States. His undaunted amiability may stand him and
us and the Colony in good stead on some day of reckoning.
He himself will always find asylum here. It is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
a pity that the Embassy did not hide Madero behind its
secure door.</p>


<h3><em>Later.</em></h3>

<p>I went to Señora Huerta’s reception with the Cardens.
N., having paid his tithe in the morning, had fled to the
country. There were few present. She received on the
lower floor of the Palace in the rooms which were once
the intimate apartments of Maximilian and Carlota.
They were handsome rooms so far as proportions go,
but were done over in doubtful taste in Diaz’s time.
The dining-room, where tea was served, looked as if
paneled in plaster and painted a hideous brownish
yellow; but I am told it is really finished in carved
Alsatian oak. On the table was one large silver épergne
bearing Maximilian’s arms; how it has managed to remain
where it is all these years I know not.</p>

<p>The room where Señora Huerta stood, which used to
be Carlota’s boudoir, is now hung with an ugly, brownish-pink
brocade; a lovely Gobelin border remains to
frame the panels of the brocade, and two exquisite
lunettes of the same Gobelin are over the windows.
The rooms are only inconveniently reached one through
the other. Visitors pass through the <i lang="es">Salon Rojo</i>, with its
big table and chairs, where the Cabinet sits when meetings
are held at Chapultepec, then through the <i lang="es">Recamara
Azul</i>, hung with blue brocade, in which is an elaborate
Buhl bed and dressing-table. Other traces of the ruler
with the blond hair and blue eyes are not in evidence.</p>

<p>The President made a speech at tea. I was standing,
two removed, on his side of the table, next to Mme.
Lefaivre and Sir Lionel. Huerta began by wishing the
Diplomatic Corps a happy new year. He went on to
say, with his usual genial ignoring of the United States,
that Mexico was not the equal of great Powers like England,
Spain, France, or Germany; that she had not their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
many blessings of culture and enlightenment; that she
was an adolescent, a minor; but that, like any nation,
she possessed a right to her own development and
evolution along her own line, and he begged the mercy
and patience of the Powers. He got balled up in some
astronomical metaphors. One heard vague references to
Jupiter and Mars; but he soon disentangled himself
with his usual <i lang="fr">sang-froid</i>. I found his speech, under the
circumstances, tragic and touching. He is backed up determinedly
against the whole world of Powers and Dominations,
but at times he must know that he is slipping,
slipping. Mexico can’t exist without the favor of the
United States, or at least without its indifference.</p>

<p>Eight years ago, in one of those interregna known to
all Mexican statesmen, Huerta was overseer of peons
building houses in the new quarter of Mexico City.
But mostly his avocations have required courage and
knowledge. He was for years head of the Geodetic Survey,
and was at one time inspector of the “National Railways.”
He was first discovered in his native town by a
passing general who needed some one for secretarial
work. Having taken the fullest advantage of the very
poor schooling of his native town, he was ready when
opportunity came. He was taken to Mexico City, where
he was brought to the attention of Diaz, through whose
influence he entered the Military Academy. After this
his qualities were speedily acknowledged and he became
an important figure in the military history of Mexico.</p>

<p>He once told N. that when, during de la Barra’s incumbency
in 1911, he was sent in to Morelos to suppress
the Zapatistas, the Cientifico party offered him many inducements
to aid in their reinstatement as rulers of Mexico.
He added that he had preferred to remain faithful to
his constitutional oath. The same thing occurred during
the brilliant campaign he carried out in the north for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
Madero against Orozco. He said, “I could have done it
easily then, because I had control of the army and the
arms, but I remained faithful to Madero, as representing
constitutional government.” Later on, he said, he became
convinced that Madero was not capable of the business
of government and that disaster was unavoidable.</p>

<p>How well I remember going once to Chapultepec
to see Señora Madero. She was in bed in the room
next the <i lang="es">Salon de Embajadores</i>, consumed with fever
and anxieties, twisting a rosary in her hot hands. She
told me, with shining eyes, of the news received that
very afternoon of the success of Huerta’s northern
campaign against Orozco, and added that he was their
strongest general and <i lang="es">muy leal</i> (very loyal). How
quickly any situation here in Latin America becomes part
of an irrevocable past!</p>

<p>N. sent a telegram to Mr. Lind in answer to his letter,
begging him to give the President his most respectful
wishes for a happy new year. This afternoon we received
the new Italian minister.</p>

<p>The cook departed an hour ago, leaving word that
her sister is dying and that she will be back in eight
days. They are apt to take time for grief in this part
of the world, and food for an Embassy is a mere detail.
The <i lang="es">galopina</i> (kitchen-maid), seen for the first time—a
pale, high-cheeked Indian girl, with her hair hanging
down her back—answered my every question by
a most discouraging, “<i lang="es">Quién sabe?</i>” The women servants
seem to be forever washing their hair, and
though it would doubtless be unreasonable and useless
to forbid it, the sight has an irritating effect. Everybody
who has really lived in Mexico has at some time
or other had food brought in by females with long,
damp, black hair floating down their backs.</p>

<p>We motored out to the Country Club, where Elim and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
I followed some golfers over the beautiful links. The
short grass was dry and springy, the air clear and cool,
without a breath of wind. As we motored home we
found ourselves enveloped in an indescribable glory—a
strange light thrown over everything by a blue and
copper sunset. The luster-tiled roof of the little Chapel
of Churubusco was like a diamond held in the sun—the
rest of the church gray and flat. All this is historic
ground for us as well as for the Mexicans. Over the
golf-links and in the fields between the Country Club
and Churubusco, our men, on their way up from
Vera Cruz in 1847, fought a desperate fight before
pressing into Mexico City. It is said we lost more than
a thousand men here, and there are grass-grown mounds
beneath which pale and bronze heroes lie together in
death. In the old Aztec days Churubusco had a temple
dedicated to the war-god Huitzilopochtli, and Churubusco
is the word the Spaniards produced from this
rather discouraging collection of letters.</p>

<p>Burnside has just come to say that a lot of “scrapping,”
as he calls it, is beginning again in the north.
I don’t know why we say “beginning again”—it never
stops. He told me about the three hundred Morelos
peasant women taken from their families and sent to
Quintana Roo, the most unhealthful of the Mexican
states, lying south of Yucatan, where it is customary
to send men only. The women had been convoyed
there with some idea of forming a colony with the unfortunate
men deported to that region for army service.
On their arrival there was a mutiny and a scramble for
the women by the soldiers. Such disorder prevailed
that the officials shipped the women back to Vera Cruz
and dumped them on the beach. Almost every woman
had a baby, but there was no food, no clothing, no one
responsible for them in any way. They were merely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
thrown there, separated from their families by hundreds
of miles. It was one of those tragedies that countless
Indian generations have enacted.</p>


<h3><em>January 4th.</em></h3>

<p>Last night N. went to a big dinner at the Jockey Club.
It was given by Corona, the <i lang="fr">chic</i> governor of the Federal
District, for the President, who made speeches at intervals.
Several times Huerta seemed to be on the verge
of mentioning the United States, but N. said he kept
a restraining eye fastened on him. After dinner N. was
called to the telephone. When he came back there was
a subtle something in the air which made him feel that
in his absence the President had drifted near the Washington
rocks, for Huerta took pains to go over and embrace
him. Later the President quoted the saying that
“all thieves are not <i lang="es">gachupines</i>,” but that “all <i lang="es">gachupines</i>
are thieves,” whereupon, catching the Spanish minister’s
eye, he felt obliged to go over and embrace him, too!
However, drifting a bit nearer to Scylla and Charybdis
matters little to him.</p>

<p>He was not responsible for the much-talked-of New-Year’s
greeting to President Wilson. It was sent out
from the Foreign Office with the other usual annual
messages to the heads of Powers, and in the Foreign
Office they explained that they <em>did not like to pass over</em>
the United States.</p>

<p>The admonition given out by the State Department
yesterday, the third to Americans, warning them not
to return to Mexico, was printed in small type in a corner
of the <cite>Mexican Herald</cite>. Formerly it would have
occupied a whole page, but the people are getting <i lang="fr">blasé</i>
about warnings. Each man looks to himself for protection—on
the even chance. I don’t know whether this
admonition was in any way an outcome of Mr. Lind’s
conference; it might easily be, as one of his strong beliefs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
is that foreigners would better get out. This is
also Carranza’s idea.</p>


<h3><em>January 5th.</em></h3>


<p>Von Hintze has returned. The excuse given for the
murder of a German subject who was quietly asleep in
the railroad station at Leon was that the guards, who
also robbed him, thought he was an American! Well,
there are some things one can’t talk about, but I
seemed to be conscious, hotly, of each individual hair
on my head.</p>

<p>No news from the <em>Chester</em> conference, but, of course,
we are all on the <i lang="fr">qui vive</i> for possible results. Things get
more chaotic all the time, and whatever is to be done
should be done quickly. There is some regard for life
and property under the near gaze of the Dictator in the
provinces he controls, but in the north reigns complete
lawlessness. Everywhere brother is killing brother, and
as for the <em>sisters</em>, they are often lassoed and captured as
if they were stampeding cattle. Educated people, who
have been prosperous all their lives, are now without
food or shelter, knowing that strangers eat at their
tables, sleep in their beds, and scatter their treasures.
If only poor old Huerta could have begun in some other
way than by riding into the capital in a path of blood
spilled by himself and others, he would probably have
been able, with recognition, to do as well as any one, and
better than most. As it is, he is like a woman who has
begun wrong. The neighbors won’t let her start again,
no matter how virtuously she lives.</p>

<p>The “bull-fight charity,” organized to raise funds for
the Red Cross, is considered the hit of the season. It
had been advertised as a “humane” fight, as the bull’s
horns were capped. However, the toreador was killed—amid
immense excitement, pleasurable rather than otherwise.
As I was coming home, about five this afternoon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
from a peaceful day at Xochimilco, I saw in every direction
immense clouds of dust. For a moment I thought
that a storm was rising, but it was only the dust raised
by the vehicles bringing spectators back from the bull-ring,
half a kilometer beyond the Embassy. Having
tried, on two awful and useless occasions, to “get the
spirit of the game,” I have put the whole question of
bull-fights out of my consciousness.</p>

<p>Several people have just been here on their way home.
Mr. Lefaivre thinks this unfortunate government might
possibly get money from abroad if it could be placed in
the hands of a commission for spending and accounting,
and would be willing to urge it on his government under
such conditions. The idea of such a commission, for
several reasons, has not been popular here. It would, of
course, be <i lang="es">mixte</i> (foreigners and Mexicans). It would reflect
on their <i lang="es">cultura</i> (a Spanish word for personal dignity
and urbanity), and on their <i lang="es">bizarría</i>, meaning gallantry,
mettle, valor, generosity. Last, but not least,
what would be the use of an arrangement where there
would be no “pickings” for anybody?</p>

<p>Well, the sun shines faithfully on what might be an
earthly paradise, and Xochimilco was beautiful beyond
words. We motored out, skirting a bit of the picturesque
Viga Canal (fifty years ago the fashionable drive of
Mexico City), to the old water-gates, where we got into
a great flatboat and were poled by a big-hatted, white-trousered
Indian along the watery aisles in between the
beautiful floating islands—Chinampas, the Indians call
them—so near that one could almost reach the flowers
and vegetables planted on them. Masses of lilies,
stocks, and pansies are now in bloom and are reflected
everywhere in the smooth water. Silent Indians, in
narrow canoes often simply hollowed out of trunks of
trees, passed and repassed us. Sometimes it was a couple<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
of women in bright garments, poling quietly along, with
heaps of flowers and vegetables between them. Sometimes
there was a family, with a bright-eyed baby lying
against the carrots and cauliflowers, the eternal trio—when
it isn’t the national sextette or octette so familiar
here. The picturesque life of a changeless people little,
if at all, modified since the coming of Cortés, unfolded
itself to our gaze. They offered us bouquets as they
passed, and bunches of carrots and radishes and aromatic
herbs, until our boat was a mass of flowers and
scent, and a dreamy, hypnotic quiescence took the place
of our strenuousness. Some one said, in a far-away
voice, “<i lang="es">La vida es sueño</i>” (“Life is a dream”). But,
fortunately or unfortunately, a practical-minded picnicker
was able to shake off his share of the strange
magic that was upon us, saying, with an attempt at
briskness, “This isn’t for us!”</p>

<p>Beautiful willow- and flower-bordered vistas had a
way of unexpectedly leading to a sight of the volcanoes,
sometimes Popocatepetl, sometimes Iztaccihuatl, when
one was sure they <em>must</em> be somewhere else. The brilliant
atmosphere of the Mexican plateau lay over the entire
picture, seeming to hold the colors of the spectrum, and
yet to remain white. There, indeed, “life is a dream.”</p>


<h3><em>January 6th.</em>
(In Memoriam.)</h3>

<p>A year ago to-day we laid away our precious Elliott.
I feel anew the sword of grief that pierced me in that
gray, foggy dawn at Zürich, when I realized that I must
get up and do something that was undoable. Countless
millions know the complete revolt of humanity against
the laying of one’s own in the earth. The beautiful Mass
at the <i lang="de">Liebfrauen Kirche</i> was strength to my soul. Pater
Braun’s handsome, earnest face, as he spoke Elliott’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
precious name in prayer and supplication, the light playing
around the pulpit, and the beatitudes in mosaic
against gold—all are graven on my heart. I could only
read through tears the words <i lang="la">Beati qui esuriunt</i>—Elliott’s
life history. And that peaceful hour with him
afterward, in the flower-filled room, when we felt that
it was only his afternoon rest we were watching over!
When they came to cover his face forever I was so
uplifted that I could turn those screws myself, instead
of leaving it to hirelings to shut the light away from
those noble features.</p>

<p>Oh, that loving heart, that crystal brain, with its
power of original thought, that gift of industry! How
far Elliott might have gone on the road of science!
Others will discover and progress, but he, so fitted to
lift the veil, has slipped behind it. Oh, my brother!</p>


<h3><em>January 7th.</em></h3>

<p>Sir Lionel is going, having been promoted to Brazil.
It is an indication to all not to “monkey with the buzz-saw”—<i lang="la">i. e.</i>,
relations between the United States and
Mexico. The English are always dignified in the treatment
of their representatives. Instead of recalling Sir
L., when faced with the advisability of a change, they
send him to Brazil, a higher-ranking post with a much
larger salary. It is said that the matter was crystallized
by his strong and entirely justified recommendation for
the proceeding to his post of the Italian minister. Italian
affairs, since the departure of Aliotti, had been in
the hands of the British; but the Italian colony here
began to get restive, feeling the necessity, in these troublous
times, of having their own representative, who had
been “waiting and watching” so long at Havana. However,
nothing can be successful down here that is against
the United States policy—right or wrong. The Carden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
incident will doubtless put the other foreign representatives
on their guard.</p>

<p>Von Hintze made a most enlightened speech at the
German Club, not long ago—in which he said that, by
reason of our unalterable geographical relations to Mexico,
the United States would always have paramount
interests here. He recommended his colony not to make
criticisms of our policy—but to accept it as inevitable
and natural.</p>

<p>I am wondering if I can go to Vera Cruz with N. to-night
without causing a panic here. He is going to confer
with Mr. Lind, from whom we had a wire this morning,
saying that he hoped N. would find it possible to
come, and that President Wilson sent his best wishes.
There is a norther blowing at Vera Cruz, and we have
the resultant penetrating cold up here. When once the
heat gets out of the body at this altitude it is difficult
to make it up. I am leaving Elim, as a sort of hostage
and an assurance to the Colony that I am not fleeing.
Dr. Ryan is living in the house, also the Parkers, and
they will all watch over him.</p>

<p>As soon as Huerta heard that N. was going to Vera
Cruz he sent one of his colonels to ask if we wanted
a special train, or a private car attached to the night
express. We take the private car, only, of course;
everybody in these days prefers traveling in numbers.
The President is always most courteous about everything.
If he cannot please Washington he does what
seems to him the next best thing—he shows courtesy
to its representative. He said to d’Antin, who went
to thank him, in N.’s name, for the car: “<i lang="es">Mexico es
como una serpiente; toda la vida está en la cabeza</i>” (“Mexico
is like a snake; all its life is in its head.”) Then he
banged his head with his small fist and said, “<i lang="es">Yo soy
la cabeza de Mexico!</i>” (“I am the head of Mexico!”) “And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
until I am crushed,” he added, “she will survive!”
D’Antin, who is a Frenchman with a Latin-American
past, probably gave him words of consolation that
would fit neither the letter nor the spirit of watchful
waiting. Huerta is magnetic. There is no disputing
that fact.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Vera Cruz</span>, <em>January 8th</em>.</h3>

<p>I am writing this hasty line in Mr. Lind’s dim room at
the Consulate, to let you know that we slipped quietly
down those wondrous slopes last night without hindrance.</p>

<p>I am decked out in a white skirt, purple hat and veil,
and purple jersey. We have struck the tail end of
the norther and the temperature is delightful. The
moving-picture man, who followed us down last night,
is now trying to persuade Mr. Lind and N. to let him
“get them” in conversation, but Mr. Lind refuses on
the plea that he is not in politics. I asked him how
about his noble Lincoln head, and he answered, “Nothing
doing; that unrepeatable head is long in its grave.”...
The admiral is announced.</p>

<h3>“<span class="smcap">La Siempre Heroica</span>,”<br>
<span class="smcap">Vera Cruz</span>, <em>January 9th</em>.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">I am writing in my state-room before getting up.
Yesterday I sent off the merest scrap by the <em>Monterey</em>.
We had a long and interesting day. We went
with Admiral Fletcher and Commander Stirling to the
<em>Dolphin</em> for lunch. Fortunately the admiral’s flag is
flying from her instead of from the <em>Rhode Island</em>, which
is anchored, while waiting for a good berth inside the
breakwater, in the rough sea beyond the Isla de los
Sacrificios.</p>

<p>Captain Earl is in command of the <em>Dolphin</em>, the despatch-boat
that successive Secretaries of the Navy have
used for their journeyings and which has just come from
“watching” the elections in Santo Domingo. The
admiral offered to put us up, but I thought it was unnecessary
to trouble him, as we were already unpacked
on the car. Admiral Fletcher, besides being an agreeable
man of the world, is an open-minded, shrewd, experienced
seaman, versed in international usage, knowing
just what the law allows in difficult decisions, where
to curtail his own initiative and fall in with established
codes, or where to go ahead. The splendid order and
efficiency of the men and matters under his command
are apparent even to my lay eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span></p>

<p>We sat on deck for an hour or so after lunch. The
harbor is like a busy town—a sort of new Venice.
Launches and barges are constantly going from one
war-ship to another. It is a very different scene from
the one my eyes first rested on nearly three years ago,
when the Ward Line boat bringing us, and the
<em>Kronprinzessin Cecilie</em> bringing von Hintze, were the
only boats in the harbor. I sent a wireless to Admiral
Cradock to let him know that we are in town, or rather
in harbor, and he wired back an invitation for lunch
to-day.</p>

<p>On leaving the <em>Dolphin</em> Nelson received his eleven
salutes, standing up with bared head in the admiral’s
barge as they thundered across the bay. We then
went over to the <em>Monterey</em> to say good-by to Armstead,
who made the journey down with us, and to see Captain
Smith, who brought us first to the land of the cactus.
The various boats, Spanish, French, and English, saluted
as we passed in the <em>Dolphin’s</em> launch.</p>

<p>In the evening Mr. Lind had a dinner for us under the
<i lang="es">portales</i> of the Diligencias. Admiral Fletcher, Consul
Canada, Commander Yates Stirling, Captain Delaney
of the commissary-ship, and Lieutenant Courts, one of
the admiral’s aides, were the guests. The Diligencias
takes up two sides of the old Plaza. The Municipal
Palace, a good Spanish building, is on the third side, and
the picturesque cathedral with its many domes and belfries
embellishes the last. The band plays every night in
the Plaza and the whole scene is gay and animated.
Women in their mantillas and rebozos, dozens of tiny
flower-girls, newspaper <em>babes</em>, and bootblacks of very
tender years cluster like flies around soft-hearted diners.</p>

<p>The <cite>Mexican Herald</cite> arrived while we were sitting
there, and we were most amused by the head-lines:
“Five-Hour Conference This Morning Between Lind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
and O’Shaughnessy Resumed in the Afternoon.” “Policy
Not Yet Known.”</p>

<p>At nine-thirty I broke up the festive gathering. The
admiral, Mr. Lind, and N. went off toward the pier,
and Commander Stirling and Lieutenant Courts brought
me back to the car in a round-about way through the
quiet streets. As half after four is a favorite breakfast
hour here, they are all “early to bed.” Vera Cruz
seems the most peaceful city in the world at the present
moment, though no port in the world has seen more
horrors and heroisms. Cortés landed there, la Villa
Rica de la Vera Cruz, as he called it, and for centuries
the seas around were pirate-infested. She has been
sacked by buccaneers times without number; bombarded
by nearly every power that has had interests here—the
Spaniards, ourselves (in 1847), the French, etc.; and
now her port is again black with battle-ships ready to
turn their twentieth-century guns upon <i lang="es">La Siempre
Heroica</i> (the always heroic). Two enemies she seems to
have done with—yellow fever and cholera. The <i lang="es">zopilotes</i>
(buzzards) that sail about in uncountable numbers find
it rather hard to get a living. I see that the cleaning up
of Guayaquil has been given to an English firm, who,
however, will use our methods. Very few Latin-American
contracts will be given to Uncle Sam these
days.</p>

<p>Admiral Fletcher would like to come up to Mexico
City, which he has never seen, but after all these months
of <em>not</em> coming he could only do so <em>now</em> officially with his
staff—uniforms, visits to Huerta and other authorities—and
that is out of the question. I could put him up
at the Embassy, with his two aides, and am quite keen
about it, and so is he; but nothing can be done until
what the newspapers call <em>Watch</em>ington has been sounded.
Mr. Lind thinks it impossible (he knows <em>he</em> can’t return),<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
as it would be taken as a sign that the President might
be wishing to change his Mexican policy. On the other
hand, if he <em>should</em> wish to change that policy, such a
visit could be the entering wedge, and lead to big things
in the way of peace and prosperity.</p>

<p>Mr. Lind continues to think that the raising of the
embargo on arms and ammunition in the north is the
easiest solution of the problem; but I am terrified at
such an issue. The last state of Mexico would be worse
than the first. It might settle the Huerta dictatorship,
but, alas! not the Mexican situation.</p>

<p>We had a most comfortable night. Practically no
trains come and go in the station at night and there is
none of the usual dust and dirt of travel, all the railroads
burning oil instead of coal. I go at ten to visit our
hospital-ship, the <em>Solace</em>, and I must now arise and buckle
me up for a long day. I have a white silk tailor-made
costume and various fresh blouses to choose from. Nelson
is busy with newspaper men, who have discovered
the car.</p>


<h3><em>January 10th, Morning.</em></h3>

<p>Before I was dressed yesterday morning Mr. Lind
appeared with a steward from Captain Delaney, bringing
me some delicious hams and bacons and other good
things from the supply-ship to take to Mexico City.
Then Captain Niblack appeared, looking very smart.
He was our naval <i lang="fr">attaché</i> in Berlin, relieved only last
summer, I think, and is a charming man of the world.
I was out of my state-room by this time and fresh
myself, but the state-room looked like Messina after
the earthquake. General Maass, military governor
or Commander of the Port, and his aide, were next to
appear. He shows his German blood in various ways
(<em>not</em> in that of language, however). He has light, upstanding
hair, German eyes, and much manner. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
were many bows and palaverings, <i lang="es">a los pies de Vd.</i>, etc.
He put his automobile at our disposition for the day,
and it was <em>my</em> car by the time he had finished offering
it after the courteous Spanish custom. The interview
finally ended by my arranging to call on his
señora in the afternoon, and by N. escorting him
from the car and down the platform. Lieutenant
Courts then arrived to take me to the <em>Solace</em>. All the
officers look so smart in their fresh linens. The <em>Solace</em>
was lying quite inside the breakwater, looking very
cool and inviting. She was painted white, with a broad,
green stripe around her—her official colors. Dr. von
Wedekin was waiting on deck with his staff. I was most
interested in seeing the perfect arrangements for the
care of all that is mortal of man; even eyes, teeth, ears,
are looked after in a most efficient and up-to-date
way. The wards are fine, large, and beautifully ventilated,
the air as sweet and as fresh as that on deck;
twenty-eight cases of malaria were being treated after
the seven days’ bout at Tampico, and half a dozen of
appendicitis. The ship carries no cargo, having the medical
stores for the whole fleet. The captain told me he
had not lost a case of anything for fourteen months.
His operating-room can compare with that of any hospital
I have ever seen and the ship also has a fine laboratory.
She is well-named the <em>Solace</em>.</p>

<p>She was leaving that afternoon for Tampico, which
is one of the dreariest spots on the earth, despite the
mighty forces at work there. Mexico’s oil is at once
her riches and her ruin. The place is malaria-ridden,
infested with mosquitoes, and the inhabitants, I am
told, have the weary, melancholy expression peculiar to
fever districts. The ships that go there are as well
screened as possible, but men on duty can’t always be
protected. I understand the mosquito that does the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
damage is a gauzy, diaphanous, rather large kind, and
the “female of the species is deadlier than the male.”</p>

<p>On leaving, Lieutenant Courts took me for a little
turn about the harbor, as it was too early for the <em>Suffolk</em>
lunch. We went around the ill-famed prison of San
Juan Ulua. Its six desolate palms are almost the first
thing one sees on entering the harbor. I regret that I
did not get a pass from General Maass to visit it. I
saw a few pale, hopeless-looking prisoners in dull blue
and white stripes, standing on the parapets or working
in the dry dock, the guns of soldiers always poking
in their faces. These are the “better class” of criminals;
there are those in dark, oozing, terrible holes who are
never allowed outside of them, and it is said that those
who survive lose in a few years all human semblance.
The foundations of the fortress were laid in early Cortés
days and the fortunes and misfortunes of the town have
always centered round it. It was from its tower that the
last Spanish flag was lowered at the time of the Mexican
independence, 1821. When first in Mexico I used to
hear that Madero was to close the prison; but, like
many of his intentions, this never became a fact. Peace
to his soul!</p>

<p>We got back to the Sanidad landing at half past twelve.
Admiral Cradock’s flag-lieutenant was waiting with
the barge and I was delivered into his hands. N. came
up at the same time and we put out for the <em>Suffolk</em>,
which has a berth inside the breakwater. The admiral,
very handsome and agreeable, not only immaculate,
but effulgent, received us on deck and we went down to
his delightful room. It contains really good things
from all parts of the world—old silver from Malta,
a beautiful twelfth-century carving (suitable for a
museum) from Greece, fine enamels from Pekin, where
Sir Christopher distinguished himself during the siege,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
and many other lovely things, besides books and easy-chairs.
He is really a connoisseur, but he said that the
ladies, God bless them, had robbed him of most of his
possessions. After an excellent lunch Captain Niblack
came in to say good-by, the <em>Michigan</em> having received
sailing orders for New York. We had such a friendly
talk with Sir Christopher, who said—and we quite concurred—that
he didn’t see any cause for feeling about
British action in Mexico, adding that he had no politics,
no idea in the world except to save British lives and property,
and that he and Admiral Fletcher were working together,
he hoped, in all sympathy and harmony. He
wants to come up to Mexico again and jokingly lays it at
Nelson’s door that he can’t. There is something so gallant
about him, but with a note of sadness; and I am
always conscious of a certain detachment in him from
the personal aims of life. We left about three o’clock.
The English use black powder for their salutes and the
thirteen guns made a very imposing effect. The ship was
enveloped in smoke, a sort of Turneresque effect, making
one think of “Trafalgar,” while the shots reverberated
through the harbor.</p>

Mr. Lind, then got into the Maass auto, which was
waiting at the Consulate door, and proceeded to pay my
respects to Señora Maass. General Maass has a breezy
house at the barracks at the other end of the town, in
front of the rather dreary Alameda, with its dusty palms
and dry fountain and general wind-swept appearance.
An endless time of parleying followed. My Spanish,
after a long day, gets tired like myself. However, I saw
them all—daughters, and nieces, and friends, and the parrot
and the dog; the beasts were most useful conversationally.
Then the family sang and played, and one of the
daughters, pretty, with a clear soprano, gave me a good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
deal of Tosti. Then more talk. I was getting desperate,
no move being made to a large, well-spread, absolutely
unavoidable, preordained table in the corner. I finally
said that Captain Niblack, who was leaving for the
United States in the morning, was waiting for me
to go to the <em>Michigan</em>. That broke through the tea
<i lang="fr">impasse</i>, and, after partaking of the collation, I finally
got away, escorted on General Maass’s arm to “my”
automobile.</p>

<p>I arrived at the Consulate, hot and tired, and without
the sustaining feeling that “duty is a well-spring in the
soul.” I was thankful to find myself at last in the <em>Michigan’s</em>
boat with Captain Niblack and Nelson, going out
across a bay of wondrous sunset effects—“twilight and
evening hour and one last call for me.” It was a marvelous
“crossing the bar.” Looking back, the outline of
the Pico de Orizaba made a soft violet mass against the
deepening sky, with a strange, red lighting up of the
top. The bay was filled with ships of destruction from
all over the world, but everything in nature for once was
soft and merciful and seemed to dissolve and harmonize
discordant and destructive meanings.</p>

<p>The <em>Michigan</em> is a huge ship, one of the first dreadnaughts,
and Captain Niblack is both enthusiastic and
earnest about his work. After a glass of something—for
a lady inclined to temperance I have drained many
pleasant cups to their cheerful lees these days—we all
went over to the <em>Chester</em>, a ship of the scout type, that
had just returned with Mr. Lind from the Pass Christian
trip. There we picked up Captain Moffett—who also
insisted on decocting something sustaining—and then
turned shoreward, where Mr. Lind was giving another
dinner for us, under the <i lang="es">portales</i> of the Diligencias.
It was quite dark, but a thousand lights from a hundred
boats made the harbor one vast jewel—not in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
“Ethiop’s ear,” but in Mexico’s poor, battered, torn
ear. At half after nine, after another pleasant dinner, I
began to feel that my bed would be my best friend, and
we went back to the car, through the quiet, well-lighted
streets. Women were leaning over the little green balconies
of the little pink houses in the classic Spanish
style, with here and there a note of guitar or mandolin.
I thought of the “Goyas” in the Louvre.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Vera Cruz</span>, <em>January 10th, 6.30</em> <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span></h3>

<p>Home to rest a little before dressing for Admiral
Fletcher’s dinner to-night, for which we decided to
stay over. We spent the morning on the <em>Michigan</em>,
Captain Niblack giving us an early luncheon, as he expected
till noon to start for New York at one o’clock.
The officers and crew were full of anticipations of home.
Then the <em>Minnesota</em>, which had arrived in the morning,
expecting to replace the <em>Michigan</em>, found orders awaiting
her to coal immediately for a trip to Panama. Captain
Simpson, her commander, had rushed in for lunch with
Captain Niblack, and there got the wireless. Captain
N. hated to tell the officers and the crew that after all
the months of waiting at Vera Cruz they were not to
leave, their hearts had been beating so high. The crews
are never allowed ashore for fear of complications, and
it is no light task to keep the thousands of sailors and
marines in Vera Cruz harbor well occupied and content
within the compass of their ships. They are, I can testify,
magnificently fed. At lunch Captain Niblack ordered
for us some of the soup the men were having, a delicious
bean soup with pieces of sweet pork; also the meat
served us was the same as theirs—a juicy, tender steak
such as I couldn’t get in Mexico City for love or money.
I also got the printed menu for the week, three full,
varied meals a day. Judging from that and the samples<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
tasted they have first-class fare, and all at an expense of
thirty cents a day for each man.</p>

<p>We had taken on board with us Wallace, the moving-picture
man, who had come with a letter to N. from
John Bassett Moore. Captain Niblack had the drill,
salutes, etc., for N. on leaving the boat, so I suppose
that brief episode of our career will be duly chronicled
in our native land. After leaving the <em>Michigan</em> we went
again to the <em>Chester</em>, and sat on deck for an hour or
so with Captain Moffett, who had many interesting
things to tell about the Tampico fight. A heavenly
breeze was blowing. Salutes were fired as usual when we
left. Some one made the little joke that they could
“hear us walking all over the harbor.” Going from one
ship to another, as we have been doing for three days,
I have received a tremendous impression of the might and
glory of our navy, and of the noble, clean, and wise
lives which must be led by the men who command the
ships.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">At Orizaba</span>, <em>(the Next Morning), January 11th, 10.30</em>.</h3>

<p>Well, traveling in Mexico in revolutionary times is
<em>all</em> that it is supposed to be! The rebels have destroyed
the track at Maltrata ahead of us, sacked and burned
fourteen provision-cars, damaged a bridge, and, officials
say, we are held up until to-morrow. It is the first time
anything has happened on this road, though all the other
lines in Mexico have been cut times without number.
Maltrata, above which the damage has been done, is the
site of the most delicate and difficult engineering-work
on the line and a tempting spot for havoc.</p>

<p>I am staying in my state-room, worn out with the comings
and goings of the last three days. A drizzling rain
is falling, the results of the norther at Vera Cruz.
Orizaba is known politely as the watering-pot of Mexico.
I say “politely,” as against a somewhat similar name<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
which you will remember is applied to Rouen. N. is
disgusted at not getting back to Mexico City, and I
dare say the town is full of all sorts of rumors about us.
He has just been to see the train-master, who has simply
had orders to await instructions; no tickets are to be
sold further than Orizaba.</p>

<p>I am glad of these moments for a little word with my
precious mother. Last night the admiral’s dinner was
most agreeable. The Military Commander Maass and
his wife were there, Admiral Cradock with two of his officers,
Mr. Lind, the Consul, Yates Stirling, and others
of the admiral’s staff. I sat on Admiral Fletcher’s
left, with Maass next to me. The conversation was in
Spanish, and I worked hard; I told the admiral that
I deserved a trip to Panama as a recompense. The
<i lang="es">norte</i> which had been announced from Tampico began
creakingly and ominously to make itself felt and heard
about half after nine. The admiral gave us an amusing
picture of the life at Tampico with a hundred refugees,
mostly women and children, on board. He said it was
a sweet and touching sight to see certain baby garments
hung out to dry on the cannon, and officers lulling the
little innocents to sleep, or engaged in other and often
unsuccessful attempts to keep the refugees pleased and
happy.</p>

<p>At about ten o’clock, after sitting on deck awhile,
the <i lang="es">norte</i> began to blow stronger. Señora Maass, stout,
elderly, and placid, did not seem to like her own <i lang="es">nortes</i>,
so we proceeded to do what was about my seventeenth
gangway that day. The northers of Vera Cruz are a
great feature of the climate. They have all sorts and degrees—the
<i lang="es">nortes fuertes</i> that nearly blow the town away;
the <i lang="es">nortes chocolateros</i> that are milder, last a long time,
and keep the place healthy and bearable, and various
others. I don’t know what kind was developing last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
night, but after an uncertain trip we were dashed up
against the Sanidad pier, where the large Maass auto
was waiting. We said good-by to Mr. Lind and Mr.
Canada at the Consulate door, and in an instant they
were blotted out in the thick darkness of the gathering
<i lang="es">norte</i>. The Maasses took us on to the station, where we
parted with all expressions of regard and compliments.
I must say they have been more than polite.</p>

<p>I went to bed immediately. Jesus, who is a gem, had
everything in order. I don’t think I would have been
able to don my filmy black gown for the dinner had it
not been for his deftness and general efficiency. At six
o’clock they hitched our car onto the morning train,
with indescribable groanings and joltings, and this is
our history up to the present moment.</p>

<p>Through the window I see only bits of a dreary station
and crowds of Indians huddled under their <i lang="es">serapes</i> and
<i lang="es">rebozos</i>. The poor wretches do so hate to get wet. It
means hours of chill until the garments dry on them.
Worried train employees are running about. I understand
that Orizaba, in spite of the “watering-pot”
effect, is a delightful resort. Many people from Yucatan
come up to recuperate—rich <i lang="es">henequén</i> and sisal
planters; there are all the beauties and marvels of the
tropics in the way of flowers and fruits, orchids, convolvuli,
ahuacate pears, pineapples, pomegranates, and
a wonderfully tonic, even temperature. If it weren’t
for the downpour I would venture out for antiques.
This is an old Spanish city and there are lovely things
to be picked up in the way of ivory and wood inlaid-work
if one is lucky. However, I don’t feel like being
watered. I haven’t had the desire, since hearing of the
hold-up, to tell you of the beauty of the scenery from
Vera Cruz, but look at those first enchanting pages of
Prescott’s <cite>Conquest</cite>. He who never saw it, describes its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
beauties as if they were spread before him. Though, for
really up-to-date reading on Mexico give me Humboldt,
1807. He still seems to have said the last and latest word
about Mexico and Mexicans as we know them to-day.</p>

<p>Two train-loads of Federal soldiers, well armed, have
just pulled out of the station, where women were weeping
and holding up baskets of food to them as they
hung out of the windows. They were laughing and
joking as befits warriors. Poor wretches! I couldn’t
help my eyes filling with tears. They go to reconnoiter
the track for us. I suppose it is known everywhere by
now that the American <i lang="fr">chargé</i> and his wife are held up
on that usually safe stretch between Orizaba and Mexico
City. A group of armed men are standing in front of my
window. They have black water-proof covers for their
large hats, like chair covers; the hats underneath are
doubtless gray felt, heavily trimmed with silver. One soldier,
apparently as an incidental effect, has a poor, red-blanketed
Indian attached to him by a lasso tightened
around the waist. Nobody pays any attention to them;
not even the women, with their babes completely concealed
and tightly bound to their backs or breasts by
the inevitable <i lang="es">rebozo</i>. One feels hopelessly sad at the
thought of the world of chaos those little heads will, in
their time, peep out upon.</p>

<p>A thick and heartbreaking book could be written
upon the <i lang="es">soldadera</i>—the heroic woman who accompanies
the army, carrying, in addition to her baby, any other
mortal possession, such as a kettle, basket, goat, blanket,
parrot, fruit, and the like. These women are the only
visible commissariat for the soldiers; they accompany
them in their marches; they forage for them and they
cook for them; they nurse them, bury them; they receive
their money <em>when</em> it is paid. All this they do and
keep up with the march of the army, besides rendering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
any other service the male may happen to require.
It is appalling what self-abnegation is involved in this
life. And they keep it up until, like poor beasts, they
uncomplainingly drop in their tracks—to arise, I hope,
in Heaven.</p>


<h3><em>3 o’clock.</em></h3>

<p>There is some idea that we may start. Men with
ropes and hatchets and picks are getting on our train.</p>


<h3><em>Later.</em></h3>

<p>We arrived at Maltrata to be met by dozens of wet
Indian women selling lemons, <i lang="es">tortillas</i>, and <i lang="es">enchiladas</i>.
Each wore the eternal blue <i lang="es">rebozo</i> and a pre-Spanish cut
of skirt—a straight piece of cloth bound around the
hips, held somewhat fuller in front. They are called
<i lang="es">enredadas</i>, from the fashion of folding the stuff about
them. Each, of course, had a baby on her back.</p>

<p>Long lines of rurales came into sight on horseback.
With full black capes or brilliant red blankets thrown
about their shoulders, their big-brimmed, high-peaked
hats, with their black rain-proof covers, these men made
a startling and gaudy picture with the underthrill of
death and destruction. We have been moving along at
a snail’s pace. In a narrow defile we came on one of the
train-loads of Federals we had seen leave Orizaba, their
guns pointed, ready to fire.</p>

<p>Well, so far, so good. We hear that it was a band of
several hundred revolutionaries who attacked the train.
The train officials managed to escape under cover of the
darkness.</p>


<h3><em>5.30.</em></h3>

<p>We have just passed the scene of pillage. Dozens of
Indians—men, women, and children—are digging out hot
bottles of beer, boxes of sardines and other conserves
from the smoking wreck. Cars, engine, and everything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
in them were destroyed after the brigands had selected
what they could carry away.</p>

<p>A white mist has settled over the mountain. Many of
the Indians are wearing a sort of circular cape made of
a thatch of bamboo or grass hanging from their shoulders—a
kind of garment often seen in wet weather in this
altitude. It is marvelous that in so few hours a new
track could be laid by the old one. We are passing gingerly
over it, and if nothing else happens we shall be
in Mexico City after midnight. I am too tired to feel
adventurous to-day and shall be glad to find myself
with my babe in the comfortable Embassy, instead of
witnessing Zapatista ravages at first hand in a cold,
gray mist which tones down not only the local color,
but one’s enthusiasm.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mexico City</span>, <em>January 12th</em>.</h3>

<p>We finally arrived about one o’clock in the morning,
to be met by many newspaper men and the staff of the
Embassy, who received us as from the wars. About
fifty soldiers got out of the train when we did; and really,
in the unsparing station light they had the appearance
of assailants rather than of protectors. In a fight
it would have been so easy to confuse the rôles. I
thought they had long since given up putting forces on
passenger-trains; it usually invites attack on account
of the guns and ammunition.</p>

<p>However, all’s well that ends well, and I have just had
my breakfast in my comfortable bed with my precious
boy. They tell me he has been “good” while his mother
was away. Mrs. Parker says he insisted on having the
lights put out before saying his prayers at night. He
was so dead with sleep when I got in that he didn’t
open his eyes; only cuddled up to me when he felt me
near.</p>

<p>The newspaper gives details of the Maltrata wrecking.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
The attacking band placed a huge pile of stones on the
rails at the entrance to the tunnel, fired on the train,
robbed the employees, took what they could of the provisions
(they were all mounted and provided with ammunition),
and disappeared into the night. Hundreds of
workmen have been sent to repair the damage, and a
thousand rurales to guard and pursue. The “Mexican”
is the big artery between this city and Vera Cruz, and if
that line is destroyed we would be entirely cut off.
Nothing gets to us from anywhere now except from
Vera Cruz. The other line to Vera Cruz—the Interoceanic—has
often been held up and is not in favor
with levanting families. It is about time for one of the
periodical scares, when they leave their comfortable
homes with their children and other valuables, for the
expensive discomforts of the “Villa Rica de la Vera
Cruz.”</p>

<h3><em>January 14th.</em></h3>

<p class="dropcap">Yesterday Huerta decided to suspend payment
on the interest on the national debt for six months,
which will free about three million pesos a month for
pacification purposes. He denies anything approaching
repudiation, but says this step was forced on him by
the attitude of the United States. It will make the
European investors rather restive under “watchful
waiting,” though they can employ the time by making
large and frequent additions to the bill they intend to
present to Uncle Sam, <i lang="es">pobrecito</i>.</p>

<p>Ojinaga has been evacuated by General Mercado,
who would better look out for his head. Huerta says
he is going to have him shot. Villa will use Ojinaga for
strategic purposes, and the refugees, four thousand officers
and soldiers and about two thousand five hundred
women and children, are eventually to be interned at
Fort Bliss. Uncle Sam will present the bill to Mexico
later on. They have been started on a four days’ march
to Marfa, where they will at last get a train. Mercado
says he only surrendered and passed on to American
soil when his ammunition gave out. The soldiers and
generals—six of these last were in Ojinaga—will not be
permitted to return to Mexico until <em>peace</em> is effected.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
From the head-lines in some <cite>Heralds</cite> I am sending you,
you can see that that won’t be immediately.</p>

<p>Of course our delay on the journey made a sensation.
Dr. Ryan heard that we were held up in a tunnel and
was planning to get to our relief by hook or crook.
He is “without fear and without reproach.” I am very
glad to be safe again in this big, comfortable, sun-bathed
house.</p>

<p>N. went to see Huerta a day or two ago. The President
was most relieved to have him safely back. He
asked him the results of his visit to Vera Cruz and N.
told him there was no change in the attitude of his
government. Huerta remained impassive, and there was
no further political conversation. He promised, however,
that he would attend to several matters of the
United States, in regard to claims, etc., affecting rather
large interests. There are some advantages in living
under a dictator, if you enjoy his favor, and Huerta
would barter his soul to please the United States to the
point of recognition.</p>

<p>While not convinced of the necessity, or even advisability,
of formal recognition, N. does realize that everything
for Mexico and the United States could have been
accomplished by diplomacy in the early stages of Huerta’s
incumbency. Now the bullying and collusive and
secret arrangements with his enemies, the revolutionaries,
to overthrow him, must eventually succeed, and
in his fall we fear Huerta will take down with him the
entire fabric of state. How often he has said, “I don’t
ask your help; but don’t help my enemies!”</p>


<h3><em>Sunday Evening, January 18th.</em></h3>

<p>To-day we had a long motor trip to the old church and
convent of Tepozotlan, with Seeger, Hay, the Tozzers,
and Elim. There were pistols under the seats, of course,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
though the road (the old post-road to the north) is not
a haunt of the Zapatistas. We drove two hours or more
through the dazzling air, the road running for miles
between picturesque fields planted with maguey, the
Indian’s all, including his perdition. Here and there are
collections of adobe huts, with bright-eyed, naked children
playing by fences of <i lang="es">nopal</i>, and sometimes a lovely
candelabra cactus standing guard. We passed through
Cuauhtitlan—a most interesting place, with its deserted,
picturesque hostelries that used to do a lively relay
trade in the old coaching days. Each carved door,
with glimpses of the big courtyard within, seems to tell
the tale of past activities.</p>

<p>Tepozotlan is celebrated for its beautiful old church,
with a fine carved façade, built by the Jesuits at the end
of the sixteenth century. It was suppressed in 1857,
under the Juarez laws of reform, and is now neglected,
solitary, and lovely. Cypresses guard the entrance to
its grass-grown <i lang="es">patio</i>, adorned by a few pepper-trees,
with here and there an occasional bit of maguey. It
was all sun-baked and radiant, receiving the many-colored
light and seeming to give it forth again in the
magic way of the Mexican plateau. We wandered
through the church, which preserves its marvelous altarpieces
in the Churrigueresque style, and admired the
gilded, high-relief wood carvings, to which time has lent
a marvelous red <i lang="fr">patiné</i>. Some of the old chapels are
still most beautifully adorned with rich blue Puebla
tiles, now loosened and falling from neglected ceilings
and walls. The adjoining <i lang="es">seminario</i>, with its endless corridors
and rooms, is dim and deserted, except for spiders
and millions of fleas; I thought at first, in my innocence,
that these were gnats, as they settled on my white
gloves. We lunched in the enchanting old <i lang="es">patio</i> of the
cloisters, where orange-trees and a <i lang="es">Noche Buena</i> tree, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
its brilliant red flowers, were growing around an old
stone well in the middle. For those hours, at least, we
felt that all was well with the world. Afterward we
climbed the belfry and feasted our eyes on the beauty unfolded
to our sight. East, west, south, and north other
pink belfries pressed themselves against other blue hills,
repeating the loveliness until one could have wept for the
beauty of it all. The almost deserted village, straggling
up to the <i lang="es">patio</i> of the church, is where Madre Matiana
was born at the end of the seventeenth century. She
made, on her death-bed, the celebrated prophecies which
have been so strangely confirmed by subsequent events
in Mexican history.</p>

<p>The Ojinaga refugees, garrison, and civilians are just
arriving after the four days’ march through the desert to
Marfa and Fort Bliss. This affair has cost $142,000 up
to date, and $40,000 were spent for new equipments for
officers. I think every officer in Mexico will contemplate,
for a brief moment, the idea of crossing the frontier.
There will be a good deal of disillusionment and
suffering in the detention camp, however, if the soldiers
are called on to comply with the hygienic rules of the
American army.</p>

<p>Jesus Flores Magon, whom we knew as Minister of
Gobernación under Madero, a strong and clever man of
pronounced Zapoteca Indian type, is going to Vera Cruz
at N.’s suggestion, to see Mr. Lind. Flores Magon, who
knows his people, says there is no use in “trying out” another
government here. Though he was in Madero’s
cabinet, he is now for the sustaining of Huerta. He thinks
another government would only mean another set of
traitors, who would, in turn, be betrayed. N. asked him
if he were convinced that Huerta had other aims in view
than the graft and personal aggrandizement his enemies
credit him with. Though not unreservedly enthusiastic,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
he answered that he thought he had within him the elements
necessary to control in Mexico, but that, like
all Indians, he was cruel. Lind is out-and-out for recognizing
the northern rebels, or, at least, raising the embargo
on arms and ammunition. A terrible policy, it
seems to me. Taking from the possessors to give to those
desirous of possessing can hardly mend things—here or
anywhere. Nothing that Mr. Lind has seen or heard has
modified in the slightest the ideas with which he arrived.</p>

<p><i lang="es">Delendus est Huerta</i> is the <i lang="fr">mot d’ordre</i>, and I find myself
assisting at the spectacle. I am dazed at this flying in
the face of every screaming fact in the situation. N.
went to see Moheno yesterday, with the usual bundle of
claims against the government, and M. said, in a wild,
distraught way: “My God! When are you going to intervene?
You are strangling us by this policy.”</p>

<p>We hear from a railroad man (they are always informed)
that there are two thousand well-armed men in
Oaxaca, doing nothing—simply awaiting orders. They
are Felicistas. Everybody is waiting to betray everybody
else.</p>

<p>I had to stop writing for a few minutes; one of those
strange accompaniments of life in Mexico has just manifested
itself—a slight earthquake. The doors that were
ajar swung quietly open and as quietly closed themselves.
The chandeliers were thrown out of plumb in a rhythmic
way; there was a sliding sound of small objects from
their position and then back. I had an unpleasant sort of
depolarized sensation. It is all over now—the <em>temblor</em>,
as they call it. But I feel as if some ghost has passed
through the room, leaving me not quite the same.</p>


<h3><em>January 20th.</em></h3>

<p>The papers have the report of the five hours’ conversation
between Flores Magon and Lind at Vera Cruz.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
Lind is reported as saying: “Flores Magon is a splendid
gentleman, with the welfare of Mexico at heart.”</p>

<p>We continually ask ourselves what is going to happen.
Mexico is not, by any means, starved out; there is
plenty of food, there is money for oil stock and bull-fights,
and other necessaries. We may have to see
Pancho Villa in a dress-suit. He has collected wives, as
he would anything else, in his <i lang="es">paso de vencedor</i> through
Mexico, and I understand that some of them are curios.
I suppose accident will decide which one he will
turn up with as “first lady in the land.” A recent portrait
of one of them drove a woman we knew nearly
crazy. It showed the “bride” decked out in an old
family necklace forcibly taken from our friend, with
other valuables, before her flight from Torreon.</p>

<p>Yesterday I went to the christening of the Corcuera
Pimentel baby. The young mother, very pretty, was
still in bed, enveloped in beautiful and costly laces, and
the house was full of handsome relatives. After I had
congratulated her, Don Luis, her father, took me out
to tea. The table was laden with all sorts of delicacies,
foreign and domestic. I partook of the delicious <i lang="es">tamales</i>,
appetizingly done up and cooked in corn-husks <i lang="es">à la
Mexicaine</i>, and drank <i lang="es">atolli aurora</i>, a thick, pink drink
of corn-meal and milk, flavored with cinnamon and colored
with a dash of carmine—though less exotic dainties
were pressed on me.</p>


<h3><em>January 21st.</em></h3>

<p>Yesterday was a busy day. To show you how difficult
it often is to get hold of Huerta,—N. was up and out at
seven-thirty, looking for him. He went to his house—gone.
He went to Popotla, a place Huerta has in the
suburbs near the <i lang="es">Noche Triste</i><a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> tree. Not there. N. came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
home. I was just starting down-town, so I drove him to
the Palace, where one of the aides said the President
might be found at Chapultepec—the restaurant, not the
castle, which he does not affect. We again went the
length of the city, from the Zocalo, through Plateros, up
the beautiful, broad <i lang="es">Paseo</i>. Huerta was just passing
through the entrance to the Park in a big limousine, followed
by two other automobiles containing secretaries
and aides. N. got out of our auto and went into that of
the President, the others keeping their distance. There is
always more or less “waiting around” on royalty. They
sat there for an hour, I remaining in our auto, during which
time N. procured the release of Vera Estañol, one of the
most brilliant of the Deputies, imprisoned since the
<i lang="fr">coup d’état</i> of October 10th. Huerta also sent one of his
aides with a note to the Supreme Court, written and
signed by him, telling the judges to render a just decision
in a case affecting American interests, which
is now before the court. This case has been in the
Embassy nearly twenty years, and four of our administrations
have tried, without result, to get justice
done through the Embassy, using every form of diplomatic
representation. Though N. saw him write the
order, and the auto which took the note started off in
the direction of the Supreme Court, and returned, having
delivered it, no one can tell what wink may later be
given the judges.</p>

<p>I came home and ordered a room to be prepared for
Vera Estañol, as, of course, he must remain with us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
until he can be shipped to the States or to Europe. I
imagine that the clean bed and the hot water and the
reading-lamp and desk will look very pleasant, after
three months in jail. N. wrote and signed a letter
to Huerta, in which he guarantees that Vera Estañol
will not mix in politics and will immediately leave
the country with his family. He is one of the most
prominent and gifted lawyers in the republic, liberal
and enlightened, and head of the Evolucionista party.
N. was out until midnight trying to find the President,
to get the final order for his release, but was, in the end,
obliged to give it up. The old man has ways of disappearing
when no one can track him to ground. This
morning, N. is after him again, and, I suppose, will bring
Vera Estañol to the house, whence he will take the
well-worn route of hastily departing patriots to Vera
Cruz.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon Mrs. Tozzer, Mr. Seeger, and I
motored out beyond Azcapotzalco, where Tozzer and
Hay are excavating. Anywhere one digs in these suburbs
may be found countless relics of Aztec civilization.
Azcapotzalco was once a teeming center, a great
capital, and there were then, as now, many cypress groves.
One of them is still supposed to be haunted by Marina,
Cortés’ Indian love.</p>

<p>Built on the site of the temple, <i lang="es">teocalli</i>, is an interesting
old Dominican church of the sixteenth century; its
great <i lang="es">patio</i>, planted with olive and cypress trees is inclosed
by a pink scalloped wall, marvelously <i lang="fr">patiné</i>. Here the
Indians came in masses, were baptized, had their
wounds bound up, their ailments treated, their strifes
allayed, by the patient friars. As we went slowly over
the broken, neglected road little boys offered us beads
and idols and bits of pottery, which are so abundant
in the fields that it is scarcely necessary to dig<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
for them. T. and C. H., for their work, simply chose
a likely-looking sun-baked mound, planted with maguey,
like dozens of others, and with twenty-five or thirty
picturesque and untrustworthy descendants of Montezuma
(one skips back six or seven hundred years
with the greatest ease when one looks at them) they
dug out an old palace. When we demanded <i lang="es">regalitos</i>
(presents), our friends drew, unwillingly, from their
dusty pockets some hideous heads and grotesque forms,
caressed them lovingly, and then put them back, unable,
when it came to the scratch, to part with them.</p>

<p>It is a heavenly spot. Here and there a pink belfry
showed itself, its outline broken by a dead black cypress;
the marvelous, indescribable hills, both near and far,
swam in a strange transparency.</p>

<p>We sat long among the grubby, mixed Toltec and
Aztec ruins, and made tea, and, in what may have
been some patrician’s parlor, watched the sun go down
in a blaze of colors, reappearing, as it were, to fling a
last, unexpected glory over the snow-covered volcanoes
and the violet hills. Every shaft of maguey was outlined
with light, the whole universe a soft spectrum. A mysterious,
blue-lined darkness fell upon us as we drove
toward the city.</p>


<h3><em>January 23d.</em></h3>

<p>N. was only able to get Vera Estañol out of the <i lang="es">Penitenciaría</i>
on Wednesday afternoon. He didn’t come
here, but was taken immediately to the station, caught
the night train to Vera Cruz, and sailed yesterday,
Thursday, by the Ward Line steamer. When N. went
to the prison with the President’s aide, carrying the order
for his release and the duly signed safe-conduct, Estañol
came into the waiting-room with a volume of Taine’s
<cite>Histoire Contemporaine</cite> in his hand, and the detached air
acquired by persons who have long been in jail. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
was scarcely any conversation, his one idea being to leave
the building and get to the train under American cover.</p>

<p>Huerta told N. yesterday that General Mercado
had been bribed by wealthy persons in Chihuahua
to go to Ojinaga on the frontier, instead of going to
Jimenez, where he had been ordered. He feels very
bitter toward Mercado, who cost him 4,000 good soldiers.
Mercado makes all sorts of counter-charges
against the other generals, especially against Orozco—of
cowardice, of placing drunken officers in important positions,
and of robbing their own Federal trains of provisions.
General Inez Salazar’s fate is tragi-comic. He
was arrested for playing “a little game of cards” on the
Texas train, never suspecting that in a free country you
could not do such a thing. After escaping the rebels and
the American authorities he was most chagrined to be
jailed and consequently identified just as he was about
to recross the border into Mexico.</p>

<p>Wednesday we had a pleasant lunch at the Norwegian
Legation. The Norwegian minister is the son of Jonas
Lie. He and his wife are cultivated people of the world,
and kind friends. Madame Lie always has delicious
things to eat, very handsomely served. One knows that
when things are well done here it means that the lady of
the house has given them her personal care. In the
evening there was bridge at Mme. Bonilla’s. The lights
suddenly went out, as we were playing, and remained
out. As is usual in such occurrences, the cry was, “At
last the Zapatistas are cutting the wires!” Madame B.
got out some beautiful old silver candlesticks and we
played on recklessly, with our fate, perhaps, upon us.
The street lamps were also dark.</p>

<p>Mexico City is lighted from Necaxa, nearly a hundred
miles away, and one of the loveliest spots in the world.
In a day one drops down from the plateau into the hot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
country; the train seems to follow the river, which
flows through a wild and beautiful <i lang="es">barranca</i>, and at
Necaxa are the great falls supplying the power for this
wonderful feat of engineering. In my mind it is a memory
of blue skies, enchanting vistas of blue mountains,
myriads of blue butterflies against falling water, bright
singing birds, and the most gorgeous and richest of tropical
vegetation, vine-twisted trees, orchids, morning-glories
of all kinds, and countless other magnificences.
I sometimes think that it is because Mother Earth is so
lavish here, asking only to give, demanding nothing of
her children, that they have become rather like spoiled
children. Every mountain oozes with precious ores. On
the coast, any accidental hole in the earth may reveal
the oil for which the world is so greedy; and each green
thing left to itself will come up a thousandfold. Marvelous,
magical Mexico! A white moon is shining in through
the windows of the front <i lang="fr">salon</i>, making my electric lamp
seem a dull thing. At this altitude the moonlight cuts
out objects as if with a steel point.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Mr. Prince, Aunt Laura’s friend, and
brother-in-law of Mr. C., came to lunch. Mr. C.
died during the bombardment, and in his last illness was
moved from house to hospital, and from the hospital,
when that was shelled, to another house, opposite the
Embassy. During the armistice Mr. P. was able to go
out for a coffin, and to take it himself on a cab to the cemetery.
This was the only way to dispose of it, the town
being under fire at the time. That same week one of
the little boys had his foot crushed by the tramway, and
it had to be amputated while shot and shell were falling
and his father was lying dead. Emma, the child who
fell through my glass roof, two years ago, has never
since walked. A chapter of tragedies! Mrs. C. is now
in the States, trying to recuperate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span></p>

<p>Hanihara, the bright secretary from the Japanese
Foreign Office, who is here to look into the conditions
and, doubtless, the possibilities of the Japanese situation
in Mexico, turned up yesterday; we used to know
him in Washington. He speaks English perfectly, and is
Europeanized, externally, to an unusual extent, but, of
course, he remains completely Japanese at bottom. I
shall give a luncheon for him at Chapultepec, with his
minister, the retiring Austrian <i lang="fr">chargé</i>, and the new Italian
minister, who fell at my door, the day before yesterday,
and was laid up with a bad knee. I had him
bound up by Dr. Ryan.</p>

<p>I saw a man yesterday who had known Villa in his
purely peon days; he said some mental, if not moral,
evolution had been going on; among other things, he
generally keeps to the regulation amount of clothing, but
a collar gets on his nerves almost as much as the mention
of Porfirio Diaz—his pet abomination. He keeps
himself fairly clean, and has shown himself clever about
finding capable agents to whom he is willing to leave the
gentler mysteries of the three R’s. We wonder who is
getting out certain polished political statements appearing
under his name. What he once did to an official
document, on an official occasion, instead of signing his
name, pen cannot relate. He evidently has military
gifts, but remains, unfortunately, one of the most ignorant,
sanguinary, and ruthless men in Mexico’s history,
knowing nothing of the amenities of life, nothing of
statesmanship, nor of government in any form except
force. And he may inhabit Chapultepec.</p>

<p>D’Antin brought home a beautiful <i lang="es">saltillo</i>, a hand-woven,
woolen sort of <i lang="es">serape</i>, about a hundred years old,
that he got from an Indian at a price so small I hate to
think of it. He saw it on the Indian on the street, one
cold night, and his clever eye realized what it was. I am<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
not quite happy about it; but I have had it disinfected
and cleaned. I can only bring myself to use it because
some one said the Indian had probably stolen it.</p>

<p>Elim is singing at the top of his voice the popular air,
“<i lang="es">Marieta, no seas coqueta porque los hombres son muy
malos</i>” (“Marieta, don’t be a coquette, because men
are very wicked”).</p>


<h3><em>January 23d, Evening.</em></h3>

<p>I spent a quiet evening reading the fascinating book
Don L. Garcia Pimentel sent me yesterday, <cite>Bibliografia
Mexicana de lo Siglo XVI</cite>. I am impressed anew with
the wonderful work done by that handful of friars, Franciscans
and Dominicans, who came over immediately
after Cortés and began with the Conquistadores the
work of Spanish civilization in the new world. Their
first acts, as they made their way through the country,
were to do away with the bloody sacrificial rites which
disgraced and discredited the Aztec civilization. They
built everywhere churches, hospitals, and schools, teaching
gentler truths to the Indians, who gathered by
thousands for instruction in the beautiful old <i lang="es">patios</i> to
be found in front of all the colonial churches.</p>

<p>One might almost say that Mexico was civilized by
that handful of friars, sixteen or seventeen in all, who
came over during the first eight or ten years following
the Conquest. Their burning zeal to give the true faith
to the Indians dotted this beautiful land with countless
churches, and an energy of which we can have no conception
changed the gorgeous wilderness into a great kingdom.
Padre Gante, one of the greatest of them, who arrived
in 1522, was related to the Emperor Charles V. He
had been a man of the world, and was a musician and an
artist. He had his celebrated school at Tlaltelolco, now
the Plaza de Santiago, which, shabby and shorn of all its
ancient beauty, is used as the city customs headquarters.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
He wrote his <cite>Doctrina Christiana</cite> and baptized hundreds
of thousands of Indians during his fifty years’ work. He
not only taught them to read and write, but started
schools of drawing and painting, at which he found them
very apt. They already possessed formulas for all sorts
of beautiful colors, and had their own arts, such as the
glazing and painting of potteries, the making of marvelous
garments of bright birds’ feathers, and of objects
in gold and silver, of the finest workmanship. In the
museum one can see beautiful old maps of Mexico City
when she was Anahuac, the glory of the Aztecs, painted
on cloth made from the maguey.</p>

<p>Fray Bartolomé de las Casas worked with Fray Gante,
and they were greatly aided by the first viceroys. Fray
Motolinía came later, and his <cite>Historia de los Indios</cite> is the
reference book of all succeeding works on <i lang="es">Nueva Espagna</i>.
The friars tried by every means to alleviate the miseries
of the Indians, and hospitals, homes for the aged and
decrepit, orphanages and asylums of all kinds were established.
The generation which immediately succeeded
the Conquest must have been a tragic spectacle, exhausted
by resistance and later on by the pitiless work
of rebuilding cities, especially Mexico City, which was
done in four years—to the sound of the whip. The viceroys
were responsible only to the <i lang="es">Consejo de las Indias</i>,
in far-away Spain, and their success came naturally to
be judged by the riches they secured from this treasure-house
of the world, at the expense, of course, of the
Indians, though many of the viceroys tried honestly, in
conjunction with the friars, to alleviate the Indian lot.
Seven or eight volumes of hitherto unpublished works
are waiting for me from Don Luis Garcia Pimentel, to one
of whose ancestors, Conde de Benavente, Motolinía dedicated
his <cite>Historia de los Indios</cite>. I have simply steeped
myself in <i lang="es">Mexicana</i>—from the letters of Cortés, the recitals<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
of Bernal Diaz, who came over with him, down to
Aleman and Madame Calderon de la Barca.</p>

<p>Well, it is getting late and I must stop, but the history
of Mexico is without exception the most fascinating,
the most romantic, and the most improbable in the world;
and the seed of Spanish civilization implanted in this
marvelous land has produced a florescence so magnetic,
so magical, that the dullest feel its charm. All that has
been done for Mexico the Spaniards did, despite their
cruelties, their greeds, and their passions. We, of the
north, have used it only as a quarry, leaving no monuments
to God nor testaments to man in place of the
treasure that we have piled on departing ship or train.
Now we seem to be handing back to Indians very
like those the Spaniards found, the fruits of a great civilization,
for them to trample in the dust. Let us <em>not</em> call
it human service.</p>


<h3><em>January 24th.</em></h3>

<p>Von Hintze came in for a while this morning. Like
all the foreign representatives, he is weary of his work
here; so many <i lang="fr">ennuis</i>, so much waiting for what they all
believe alone can be the outcome now—American supremacy
in some form.</p>

<p>Shots were heard in town last night. Dr. Ryan,
who is making his home with us, thought it might be the
long-threatened <i lang="es">cuartelazo</i> (barracks’ revolution), and
went out to see, but it turned out to be only a little private
shooting. The Burnsides have gone to live at
Vera Cruz.</p>


<h3><em>January 26th.</em></h3>

<p>Only a word before beginning a busy day. I must go
out to Chapultepec to see that the luncheon of twelve,
for Hanihara and Cambiaggio, is all right. The town is
filling with Japanese officers from the <em>Idzuma</em>, lying at
Manzanillo. There will be a veritable demonstration for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
them, indicating very completely the anti-American
feeling. There is an enormous official program for every
hour until Friday night, when they return to their ship.</p>


<h3><em>Evening.</em></h3>

<p>My luncheon for Hanihara went off very pleasantly,
at Chapultepec. That restaurant is the knife with which
I have cut the gordion knot of entertaining. The new
Italian minister was there, the Norwegians, Mr. E. N.
Brown, president of the National Railways, Parra, from
the Foreign Office, and others. We reached home at
four o’clock, and I drove immediately to the Garcia
Pimentels, where Don Luis was waiting to show me some
of the special treasures in his library. Up-stairs, the
handsome daughters and their equally handsome friends,
married and single, were sewing for the Red Cross. We
meet there every Tuesday. Each daughter had a beautifully
embroidered <i lang="es">rebozo</i> thrown over her smart Paris
gown <i lang="es">à la Mexicana</i>—heirlooms of the family.</p>

<p>The house is one of the noble, old-style Mexican
edifices, with a large <i lang="es">patio</i>, and a fine stairway leading
up to the corridor that winds around its four palm- and
flower-banked sides. Large, handsome rooms, with pictures,
rare engravings, priceless porcelains, and old brocades,
open from the corridor. I merely put my head in
at the door of the big drawing-room where they were
working, as Don Luis was waiting for me in his library
down-stairs. I spent a couple of delightful hours with
him, among his treasures, so lovingly guarded through
generations. Oh, those fascinating title-pages in reds
and blacks, that thick, rich-feeling hand-woven paper,
that changeless ink, fit to perpetuate those romantic histories
and the superhuman achievement of the men of
God! I could scarcely put down the beautifully written
letter of Cortés to Charles V., wherein he tells of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
Indians as he found them. They so closely resemble the
Indians as <em>I</em> have found them.</p>

<p>Many of Don Luis’s most valuable books and manuscripts
were found in Spain, and his library of <i lang="es">Mexicana</i>
embraces everything obtainable down to our own time.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
His wife is a charming woman, very <i lang="fr">grande dame</i>, cultivated,
and handsome. She and her daughters are always
busy with countless works of charity. Just now they are
busy making up little bundles of layettes for the maternity
home. It does make one’s fingers nimble to see
Indian women obliged to wrap their babies in newspapers!</p>

<p>I had just time to get home and dress for dinner at the
British Legation, but we came away at half past nine,
leaving the rest of the party playing bridge. I had on
again the gray-and-silver Worth dress, but I feel sad
without my black things.</p>


<h3><em>Evening, January 27th.</em></h3>

<p>This afternoon I went with de Soto to see Mme.
Lefaivre at the Museo Nacional, where she is copying an
old Spanish screen. It is always a pleasure to go through
the lovely, sun-baked <i lang="es">patio</i>, filled with gods and altars<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
of a lost race. Many of them, found in the <i lang="es">Zocalo</i>, have
made but a short journey to their resting-place. De Soto
is always an agreeable companion for any little excursion
into the past—though it isn’t the <em>past</em> we are dreaming
about, these days. And as for his looks, put a lace
ruff and a velvet doublet on him and he would be a
“Velasquez” of the best epoch.</p>

<p>Mme. Lefaivre, enveloped in an apron, was sitting on
a little step-ladder before the largest screen I have ever
seen, its eight mammoth leaves representing various
amorous scenes, lovers, balconies, guitars, etc.—all most
decorative and truly ambassadorial. I told her that
nothing but the Farnese Palace would be big enough
for it, and the light of dreams—the kind of dreams we
all dream—appeared in her eyes. The big sala was getting
a bit dim, so she left her work and we started for a
turn through the museum. When we found ourselves
talking of Huerta by the “Morning Star,” a mysterious,
hard-faced, green god (his little name is Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli),
I thought we might as well take a turn in the
motor; so we went up to Chapultepec and continued the
discourse under the cypresses, which are growing, though
slowly, with the living events that alone really interest
one. The past is for those with peace and leisure.</p>


<h3><em>Evening.</em></h3>

<p>A quiet day, but we are distressed beyond words at the
renewed reports of a lifting of the embargo on arms and
ammunition for the rebels. I feel as if I couldn’t stand
it, and N. even felt that he ought to resign if it happens.
The ship of state is going so inevitably on the
rocks. He will make some sort of protest to Washington
against the advisability of this move. Villa’s
cry is “On to Mexico,” and he may get there, or rather,
here—if we decide to carry him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span></p>

<p>It appears that he is becoming daily more intoxicated
by the favors of the United States. No one is more surprised
than he at his success with the powers that be,
and as for the vogue he has with the confidential
agents, they tell me his face is one broad grin whenever
their names are mentioned. However, this doesn’t mean
he is going to try to please them. Just now he wants
Huerta’s head, but that foxy old head can have asylum
here. Shouts and shots were heard an hour or so ago,
but probably only from some Zapatistas near town.</p>

<h3><em>January 29th.</em></h3>

<p class="dropcap">Yesterday the handsome Mexican set came for
bridge, and in the evening we went to dine at Señor
Pardo’s house. He is the clever attorney for the “Mexican”
railways. Federico Gamboa and his wife were
there. Gamboa is most amusing, with one of those
minds that answer to the point in conversation, what the
French call <i lang="fr">le don de la réplique</i>. He was Minister for
Foreign Affairs last summer, and resigned to run for
President, as choice of the Clerical party. Huerta said,
quite frankly, of him to N. a few days ago, “I told him I
liked him and wished him well, but if he had been elected
President I should have had him shot.”</p>

<p>Gamboa’s answer to Mr. L. last August, though not
satisfactory to <em>us</em> when laid by Mr. Wilson before Congress,
remains a dignified, clever, and unimpeachable <i lang="fr">exposé</i>
of the Mexican situation from <em>their</em> point of view,
which is that the United States, by every international
law, is unwarranted in interfering in their interior affairs,
as these, however unfortunate, are those of a sovereign
state. They never got over the fact that the communications
Mr. Lind brought with him were tactfully addressed
to no one in particular, and referred to the
government as “the persons who at the present time
have authority or exercise influence in Mexico.” They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
consider that if they even once allowed such counsel from
the United States they would compromise indefinitely
their destinies as a sovereign state.</p>

<p>As for the phrase “the United States will not hesitate
to consummate matters, especially in times of domestic
trouble, in the way that they, the United States, consider
best for Mexico”—it is graven on the mind of
every Mexican who can read and write. Concerning our
professions of friendship, which left them decidedly cold,
Gamboa neatly said that never could there be a more
propitious time for displaying it, that we had “only
to watch that no material or military assistance of any
kind be given to the rebels who find refuge, conspire, and
provide themselves with arms and food on the other side
of the border.” He further quietly states that he is
greatly surprised that Mr. Lind’s mission should be
termed a “mission of peace,” as, fortunately, neither
then nor to-day had there existed any state of war
between Mexico and the United States. The whole
document is the tragic and bootless appeal of a weak
nation to a strong.</p>

<p>Gamboa has had numerous diplomatic posts. He was
minister to Brussels and to The Hague, and special ambassador
to Spain to thank the King for participation
in the Centenary of 1910....</p>

<p>After the Pardo dinner, two bright-eyed, clear-voiced
Mexican girls, one of them Pardo’s daughter, sang Mexican
songs with the true beat and lilt to them. Hanihara
was also there, listening to the music in the usual detached,
Oriental manner. The Japanese officers are being
tremendously <i lang="fr">fêted</i>, fed by each and every department
of the government, till I should think their
abstemious “little Marys” would rebel.</p>

<p>After dinner we walked home, a short distance, in the
mild night, under a strangely low and starry sky. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
seemed to me that by reaching out I could have had a
planet for my own. The streets were deserted, save for
an occasional Mexican, hurrying home, with his scarf
across his mouth. There is a tradition here about not
inhaling the night air. Here and there a <i lang="es">guardia</i> shivered
in the shadows, as he watched his lantern, which
he always places in the middle of the four crossings.
One can walk with jewels gleaming, and without fear,
under the Dictator.</p>

<p>Dr. Ryan left last night for Washington. I don’t like
to interfere with any one’s <i lang="fr">premier mouvement</i>, but I
know it for an expensive, bootless trip. No one will care
what he thinks about the certain consequences of the
raising of the embargo.</p>

<p>The rebels have just destroyed twenty-two huge tanks
of oil near Tampico, destined for the running of the railroad
between San Luis Potosí and the coast. I think
I told you Mr. Brown said that the gross receipts had
never been so big on his lines as last month, in spite of
the danger in traveling, but that they could not keep
pace with the immense damage going on all the time.
Mr. Brown is the self-made man of story. He began at
the foot of the ladder and is now the president of the
“National Railways”; quiet, poised, shrewd, and agreeable.
Mexico owes him much.</p>


<h3><em>Evening.</em></h3>

<p>The Mexican papers come out with the statement that
President Wilson can’t raise the embargo on arms and
ammunition without the consent of Congress, which, if
true, removes it as an immediate calamity.</p>

<p>This morning they rang up from the American grocery
to say that the stores ordered yesterday had not arrived,
as the man who was delivering them was taken by the
press-gang, with all the provisions. A nice way to popularize
a government!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span></p>

<p>Nelson has been requested by the powers that be
to use his influence about the release of a certain American,
the suggestion being added that he should not be too
cordial with Huerta in public, as the United States was on
official, <em>not</em> friendly terms with Mexico. The old man
would shut up like a clam and never raise a finger for N.,
or any American, or any American interests, if N. did
not treat him with <em>both</em> public and private courtesy.
In these difficult days the position here is almost entirely
a personal equation. N. has danced the tight-rope,
up to now, to the satisfaction of almost everybody,
in spite of the inevitable jealousies and enmities. It is
entirely due to N.’s personal efforts that the Pius Fund
of $43,000, has just been paid; due to him that many
prisoners have been released, and that many material
ends have been gained for the United States.</p>

<p>I think history will testify that Huerta showed much
tact in dealing with us. His latest remark is, “If our
great and important neighbor to the north chooses to
withhold her friendship, we can but deplore it—and try
to perform our task without her.”</p>

<p>Elim asked me, yesterday, “Where is our Uncle Sam,
that everybody talks about?” He thought he was on
the track of a new relative.</p>


<h3><em>Later.</em></h3>

<p>A military revolt is brewing here—Felicista. N. got
wind of it. If it comes, they must give us Huerta, and
have so promised. We have had comparative, very comparative,
quiet for a few weeks, and now things are
seething again.</p>

<p>There is a room here always ready, which we call
<i lang="de">nacht asyl</i>, and various uneasy heads have rested there in
the famous “bed of the murderess.” Yesterday I bought
a lot of lovely dull blue-and-white <i lang="es">serapes</i> for the
floor and couch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span></p>

<p>On returning from bridge at Madame Lefaivre’s, where
I left de Soto losing with more than his usual melancholy
distinction, I found the Japanese minister with the captain
of the <em>Idzuma</em>, in full regimentals, come to call—but
N. was out. The captain said he wanted to express
especially and officially to N. his appreciation of all the
courtesies he had received from Admiral Cowles, and the
other officers of our ships at Manzanillo. He spoke
French and English only fairly well, as they do. I
was very cordial, of course, and said that in these
difficult moments all must be friends, must stand by
one another, and show mutual understanding of difficulties.
As I looked at him I thought, for some reason,
of the horrors suffered and the deeds of valor performed
by his race in the Russo-Japanese War, without
question or thought of individuals. He espied
Iswolsky’s photograph and Adatchi showed him Demidoff’s
picture, saying that Elim was his namesake.
They never forget <em>anything</em>.</p>

<p>The officers had all been out to the celebrated pyramid
of San Juan Teotihuacan to-day, with the Minister
of Public Instruction. It is a fatiguing trip, but an excursion
always arranged for strangers of distinction. (I
made it with Madero, mounting those last great steps,
exhausted and dripping, on his arm.) They, the Japanese,
were going to the Jockey Club, where Moheno, the
Minister for Foreign Affairs, is to give them a dinner.
The government is so in debt to the various restaurants
here that they couldn’t get credit for the dinner at Silvain’s,
as first planned.</p>

<p>I met Lady Carden at bridge this afternoon. She
feels badly at the way things have developed for her
husband. He has been called to London “to report”; <i lang="fr">à
la</i> Henry Lane Wilson to Washington, I suppose.
Hohler, who was <i lang="fr">chargé</i> when we first came to Mexico,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
is already <i lang="fr">en route</i> from England to take over the Legation
during Sir Lionel’s absence—but I suppose Sir L.
will never return. I told Lady Carden to give Sir Lionel
my best regards, and added that it wasn’t, by any
means, <em>all</em> beer and skittles at the Embassy.</p>

<p>Sir L. shouldn’t have tried, however, to “buck” the
United States. All the representatives have become a
bit more cautious as to how they approach “the policy,”
since the unpleasant newspaper notoriety Sir Lionel and
Paul May received. Lady Carden is not going, I am
glad to say, and we are all making plans to console her
for Sir L.’s absence.</p>


<h3><em>January 31st.</em></h3>

<p>Your cable “Love” received yesterday. I sent a
cable, “<i lang="la">Bene</i>,” in answer. I have been thinking all day
of those hours, many years ago, when my precious
mother was lying with me, her first-born, in her arms.</p>

<p>N. is in receipt of a proclamation from revolutionary
agents in Mexico City. The part referring to foreigners
states that any protection given by them to Huerta or
to his intimates will result in their immediate execution,
and that <em>no</em> flag will be respected in such cases. It
is one of those nice, little, confidence-inspiring documents
which induce one to ponder on the Mexican situation,
not as it might be or ought to be, but as it <em>is</em>. Its caption,
“<i lang="es">La revolución es revolución</i>,” is completely expressive.</p>


<h3><em>February 1st. Afternoon.</em></h3>

<p>A few lines while waiting for tea and callers. This
morning we made a wonderful run out the Toluca road
with Seeger and Mr. and Madame Graux, our Belgian
friends, <i lang="fr">Chemins de fer secondaires</i>, as we call them.
After Tacubaya the road rises high above the city, and
for miles we motored along the heights, through stretches
of dazzling white <i lang="es">tepetate</i> and pink <i lang="es">tezontle</i>, the buildingstones<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
of the city from immemorial days. The road was
fairly alive with Indians bringing in their wares, this
Sunday morning. They came from Toluca, seventy kilometers
distant, moving tirelessly over their roads with
the quick, short Aztec trot, and bearing such loads of
pottery, baskets, and wood, that nothing can be seen
of them but their feet. This is also a Zapatista country,
and we had provided ourselves with three pistols.
High in the hills could be seen the smoke of camp-fires,
Zapatistas <em>or</em> charcoal-burners. It was on this road that
the son of the Minister of War, Blanquet, was held up
about three weeks ago. His party was stripped and its
members sent home as they were born, even that last
possible covering, the floor-rug of the motor, being removed.</p>

<p>However, beyond being stopped at intervals by <i lang="es">gendarmes</i>,
who tried, unsuccessfully, to make us leave our
pistols at the <i lang="es">jefetura</i> of their little village, we were not
interfered with. Our cry of <i lang="es">Embajada Americana</i>, though
not over-popular now, had not lost all its potency. In
spite of the dazzling sun it is very cold on the heights,
and in the little village where we stopped to “water”
our car a coughing, sneezing, sniffling crowd of half-naked,
shivering Indians gathered around us, evidently
suffering from one of those bronchial epidemics so prevalent
in these thin, high atmospheres. I fear that our
coppers, though acceptable, were not therapeutic, as,
doubtless, they all rounded up at the nearest <i lang="es">pulquería</i>
after our departure. We could not decide to turn lunch-ward,
but kept on and on, until we had dipped into the
Toluca Valley as far as the statue of Hidalgo, commemorating
the spot where he met the viceregal forces in
1821. It always seems to me a sad spot, for when the
Spaniards fell, with the exception of Diaz’s thirty years,
the last stable government of Mexico also fell.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp49" id="i_172fp" style="max-width: 40.625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_172fp.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center">THE GUARD THAT STOPPED US</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span></p>

<p>At the base of the statue three Indian women were
sitting—<i lang="es">enredadas</i>. Each had a baby slung over her
back and a burden by her side, giving the scene the
mysterious, changeless, lonely Indian note. In Mexico,
nothing is ever missing from any picture to make it beautiful
and peculiarly itself.</p>

<p>A very gratifying letter came to-day from Mr. John
Bassett Moore, counselor of the State Department.
There are so many difficulties, so many enmities ready
to lift their poisoned heads, so many delicate transactions,
so much hanging in the balance, that it is gratifying
to have, sometimes, an appreciative word from headquarters.
Also a very nice letter came from General
Crozier. I am so glad of that Mexican visit of his two
years ago. He will understand just what the situation
is—and many things besides.</p>

<p>Nelson spent all Saturday morning getting the 1914
instalment of the Pius Fund, the twelfth payment since
the Hague decision in 1902. Diaz intended to pay off
the principal, but now, of course, the country is in no
condition to do so. We went down to Hacienda
(Treasury Department). I sat in the auto in the sun,
in the historic <i lang="es">Zocalo</i>, from immemorial days the focus of
Mexican events. The officials had only $37,000 of the
$43,000, but told N. to return at half past twelve,
and they would have the other six for him. I couldn’t
help wondering where they got it. Finally it was all
safely deposited in the bank. We then picked up the
Graux at the Hotel Sanz and motored out for luncheon
and golf at the Country Club.</p>


<h3><em>February 1st, 10.30</em> <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span></h3>

<p>To-night has come the long-feared cable from Washington
stating that the President intends to raise the embargo
on arms and ammunition. The note was for
Nelson’s special information, not for delivery to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
Foreign Office yet, but the hour will come when he will
have to gird himself to do the deed. It has been sent
to every chancery in Europe, where it will raise a storm,
to blow hard or not, according to the amount of material
investments in Mexico. We scarcely know what to
think; we are dazed and aghast. I am glad that a few
hours, at least, must elapse before the facts will get out.
I shall hardly dare to venture forth unveiled. Courteous
as the Mexicans have been to Nelson and myself, some
day, in face of the terrible catastrophes we have brought
upon them, their patience must fail. This act will not
establish the rebels in Mexico City or anywhere else,
but will indefinitely prolong this terrible civil war and
swell the tide of the blood of men and women, “and the
<em>children</em>—oh, my brothers.”</p>

<p>I think Wilhelmstrasse, Downing Street, Quai d’Orsay,
Ballplatz, and all the other <i lang="fr">Ministères</i> will pick many a
flaw in the President’s document; but what can they do
except anathematize us behind our backs?</p>


<h3><em>February 2d.</em></h3>

<p>My first thought, on awaking this morning, was of the
irremediable catastrophe threatening this beautiful land.
Nelson says he thinks Huerta will disregard it, as he has
disregarded all other moves of Mr. Wilson; but it can
be nothing but a further source of terrible embarrassment.</p>


<h3><em>February 3d, 11</em> <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span></h3>

<p>The second telegram has just come, saying that the
President intends, within a few hours, to raise the embargo,
and that N. is to inform all Americans and
foreigners. I keep repeating to myself: “God! God!
God!” A generation of rich and poor alike will be at the
mercy of the hordes that will have new strength and
means to fight, and eat, and pillage, and rape their way
through the country. There will be a stampede of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
people leaving town to-night and to-morrow, but those
in the interior, what of them? There is sure to be violent
anti-American demonstration, especially in out-of-the-way
places.</p>


<h3><em>12.30.</em></h3>

<p>The news previously leaked out from Vera Cruz last
night. Nothing gets out from the Embassy, as our staff
all happen to know how to keep their counsel. It is what
Mr. Lind has wanted for months, and I suppose the
news was too satisfactory to keep. You will read it
in to-morrow’s Paris <cite>Herald</cite> and the <cite>Journal de Genève</cite>.
Don’t worry about us. We will have first-class safeguard
<em>if</em> Huerta declares war. He may not. It is
his policy, and a strong one it has been, to ignore
Washington’s proclamations. On the other hand, he
will have no intention of being caught by Villa, like
a rat in a hole; and war with us may seem to him a
glorious solution of his problems. Villa and Carranza
will not arrive in the city together. No street is
broad enough to permit the double entry of their contrary
passions, violence, and greed.</p>

<p>It is “to laugh” when Villa is thanked publicly and
officially for his kind promises in regard to life and property
in the north.</p>


<h3><em>February 3d. Evening.</em></h3>

<p>A busy day—as you can well imagine. N. had to
inform the various legations. I went down-town with
him for luncheon, a thing I never do. We met the Spanish
minister driving up the <i lang="es">Paseo</i> in his victoria—a
pathetic figure. He has had so much worry and heartbreak
over the situation and has been so helpless in the
face of the disasters which have befallen his nationals
that he is beyond surprise. Upon hearing the news
he merely made a tired gesture of acquiescence. To him
the raising of the embargo was, doubtless, only one more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
inexplicable thing. Von Hintze was out, and we next
stopped at the French Legation, just opposite the German.
Ayguesparsse, the secretary, possessed of one of
the most elegant silhouettes in the world, was more than
polite, but quite impassive, as he came out with Nelson
to speak a word to me. He is married to a handsome
young Mexican—the sister of Rincon Gaillardo, Marqués
de Guadalupe—whose time, strength, money, and
life, if need be, are at the disposition of his country.</p>

<p>When we got to the restaurant in Plateros, the most
public and alarm-allaying spot we could think of, the
newspaper men assailed N. with questions. The “story”
that they are after is what the relations of Huerta
would be to N. and the Embassy, and they announce
that they were not going to let the <i lang="fr">chargé</i> out of their
sight.</p>

<p>After lunch, at which Mr. S. joined us, we went to the
British Legation. N. gave Sir L. the news, while I
walked in the garden with Lady C., both of us wilted,
with nerves on edge. I came home, rested for a few minutes,
and then dressed, and went out to fulfil my afternoon
program of calls, turning up late for bridge at
Madame Simon’s. She asked me squarely, though in
the politest of French, “What is your government
doing?” I saw many people during the afternoon,
but, apart from her greeting, there was no word of
politics. I think the matter is too distasteful to the
public to be discussed with any one like myself, where
care in the expression of feeling is necessary.</p>

<p>I drove home with Lady C., who was quietly aghast at
the situation, just in time to get into a tea-gown and
down-stairs for dinner. In the <i lang="fr">salon</i> Seeger and the
Graux (who leave to-morrow for Vera Cruz and New
York) were waiting. N. telephoned that he was at the
Palace, just going in to see Huerta. You can imagine that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
we had a lively dinner of surmises. He returned barely
in time to say good-by to the Graux, and after they left
we sat up late to talk over the appalling situation.</p>

<p>Sir Lionel was with the President when N. got there.
From the violent sounds coming through the half-opened
door, N. thought that the old man was at last
losing patience and control, and prepared himself for the
worst. However, when N. finally went in Huerta was
perfectly calm and had never been more friendly. He
never mentioned President Wilson’s name, and concerning
the raising of the embargo quietly remarked that it
would not change matters much, but would merely give
a recognized name to the smuggling over the border that
had been going on for three years. He kept repeating
that the future would justify him; that he had had
nothing to do with the killing of Madero; that the attitude
of the administration toward him was simply “a
persecution.” N. said he never flinched. He terminated
the interview by saying that he greatly appreciated
N.’s public as well as private courtesies, and that
he was “very necessary to the situation,” whereupon
he ordered <i lang="es">copitas</i>, and the embargo question was dismissed.</p>

<p>Apropos of <i lang="es">copitas</i>, while we were talking N. was
rung up to hear that an English woman reporter and
Wallace, the cine man, sent us from the State Department,
had been put in prison for trying to take a photograph
of Huerta at the Café Colon, while he was taking
his <i lang="es">copita</i>. They were both released at a late, or rather
an early hour, and I think they richly deserved their
experience. Huerta’s reputation for drinking is very
much exaggerated.</p>

<p>The hall, stairway, and chancery were black with reporters
all the evening, until one o’clock. It has been a
long day of responsibility, excitement, and fatigue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span></p>


<h3><em>February 4th.</em></h3>

<p>The newspapers have appalling head-lines about President
Wilson. <i lang="es">El Puritano</i>, with his mask off, the
avowed friend of bandits and assassins, is about the
mildest sample.</p>


<h3><em>Evening.</em></h3>

<p>Another full day. I had errands all the morning. In
the afternoon, after being undecided as to whether I
would shine by my absence or turn the full light of my
American countenance on my Mexican friends, I decided
to make calls. I found everybody in. I went first to
Señora Gamboa, where I had to talk Spanish. Fortunately,
they have a few very good antiques on which to
hang conversation. Then I went to see the Evanses.
They have bought a handsome old Mexican house which
we are all interested in seeing them modernize without
spoiling. After that I drove out to Tacubaya, and on
the way out the broad <i lang="es">calzada</i> saw the <i lang="es">leva</i> at work.
There were about twenty men hedged in by lines of
soldiers, and two or three disconsolate-looking women.</p>

<p>Señora Escandon’s house is situated in the midst of
one of the beautiful gardens for which Tacubaya is celebrated,
inclosed by high walls over which run a riot
of vines and flowers. I found her and her daughter,
Señora Soriano, at home. The Spanish son-in-law is
a mechanical genius and spends this revolutionary period
peacefully constructing small, perfect models of war-ships
and locomotives. I shall take Elim there when “the
fleet” is on the little lake in the garden. The Escandons
are people of immense wealth, agreeable and cultivated,
but, like all their kind, aloof from politics. Their perfect
and friendly courtesy made me more than a little sad.</p>

<p>Going home for a moment, I found Clarence Hay
with Nelson at the gate, and drove him down-town. I
enjoyed talking English and hearing it instead of speaking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
broken Spanish or listening to broken French. We
browsed about in an antique-shop and did a little refreshing
haggling. I stopped at Madame Simon’s on my
way back, where I found Rincon Gaillardo, who is, among
other things, chief of the <i lang="es">rurales</i>.</p>

<p>He had many interesting things to say about hunting
for Zapatistas, which seems to be the biggest kind of
“big-game” shooting. After descending unexpectedly
upon sleeping villages the Zapatistas retreat to their
mountain fastnesses. By the time word reaches the
point where <i lang="es">rurales</i> are stationed, the worst has been
done. The next day innocent-looking persons are begging
for a centavo or working in the fields. They were
the bandits of the night before! It needs a Hercules to
clear this mountainous country of “the plague of brigandage.”
A gun, a horse, and full power are naturally
more attractive than a plow and a corn-field.</p>

<p>There are rumors of a student demonstration to-morrow—it
is Constitution Day—when they propose to
march the streets crying, “Death to Wilson!” Everybody
was not only polite, but even affectionate in their
greetings to me. Whatever they thought of yesterday’s
raising of the embargo they kept to themselves or expressed
when I was absent. Even Rincon Gaillardo,
who is giving his <em>all</em>—time, money, brain—to the pacifying
of the country <em>under</em> Huerta, maintained his
exquisite calm.</p>

<h3><em>February 6th.</em></h3>

<p class="dropcap">There was no disturbance of any kind yesterday.
Never were the streets more peaceful, nor the heavens
more calmly beautiful. Madame Simon had a luncheon
for the new Austro-Hungarian minister, and afterward we
all motored out the Toluca road, driving on till from a
high mountain place we could see the setting sun filling
the stretches of the Toluca Valley with translucent
flame colors, mauves, reds, and browns. It was like
some new Jerusalem or any other promised glory.
Every time we saw a group on horseback we wondered
if it were the redoubtable Zapatistas who make that
part of the world so unquiet. It was all carefully patrolled,
however, with armed men at intervals, cartridge-belts
full, and guns across their saddles.</p>

<p>Our party would have been a neat little haul for brigands:
the Austro-Hungarian minister, the Italian minister,
Joaquin Garcia Pimentel, Señor and Señora Ösi,
Madame Simon, and myself. Señora Ösi had on a magnificent
string of pearls, likewise a huge diamond pin
that blazed in the setting sun. I left my jewels at home,
and Madame Simon kept hers well covered. I wonder
that we <em>did</em> get back as we went. It was marvelous, dropping
down from the heights to the glistening town, in the
mysterious Mexican half-light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span></p>

<p>I wonder what President Wilson is going to do about
the revolution in Peru? I see they have deported Billinghurst
from Callao, and Augusto Durand, the revolutionary
chief, has assumed the Presidency. There was
a price on his head a day or two before. It will take
more than one administration to cure the Latin-Americans
of their taste for revolutions. Have sent you a
<cite>Cosmopolitan</cite>, with a story, “Two Fools,” by Frederick
Palmer; it deals with a certain burning side of the Mexican
situation, and has excited much comment.</p>


<h3><em>February 8th. Evening.</em></h3>

<p>Yesterday we went out to the beautiful San Angel Inn
for tea, six of us in one motor, two empty motors following.
Motoring about this marvelous plateau is one of
the joys of Mexican life. We watched the sunset over
the volcanoes until the rose-tinted “White Lady,” Iztaccihuatl,
was only a gigantic form lying against a purple
sky, covered with a blue-white shroud; then we raced in
to dine with Clarence Hay and the Tozzers, who had a
box for a mild circus performance in the evening.
The night before last, so von Hintze told N. (and he is
always thoroughly informed), forty men and officers in
the Guadalupe Hidalgo barracks were shot. They were
accused, probably justly, of a plot against Huerta. For
days there have been persistent rumors of a military uprising—<i lang="es">cuartelazo</i>,
as they call it. Perhaps at the predestined
hour one such rising will succeed. If Huerta is
forced into bankruptcy and can’t pay his troops, what
will become of <em>us</em>, the foreigners? He stated the full
truth about elections here when he said that conditions
were such that the government of the nation must
necessarily be in the hands of the few. A thoroughgoing
dictatorship is what he doubtless thinks the best solution—from
a close acquaintance with his own people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span></p>

<p>This morning, after Mass at nine o’clock, I started with
Seeger, Hay, the Tozzers, and Elim for Texcoco. It was
marvelous, speeding through the soft, yet brilliant, air,
each turn of the wheel bringing us to historic spots.
Texcoco was the “Athens” of Mexico in Aztec days,
and the whole length of this now so-dusty road was
done in canoes and barques. There is a great column
near Chapingo which points the spot Cortés started
from in his brigantine, in his last desperate and successful
attempt at the conquest of the City of Mexico. It
was from the ridge of hills beyond that the conquerors
first looked down on the marvels of Tenochtitlan, set
among its shining lakes and its myriad gardens.</p>

<p>We found it was market-day at Texcoco, and Indian
life was beating its full around the old plaza with its
Aztec sun-dial, palms, and eucalyptus. Here the Indians
set up their innumerable booths with their potteries,
baskets, blankets, fruits, and vegetables. We
were most amused watching a crowd gathered about
a steaming caldron. In it a pig, his outline still quite
intact, was converting himself into soup as fast as
fire and water could assist him. Cortés, in one of
the famous letters, gives as detailed an account of an
Indian market as if he were a modern traveling agent
sending back data to the firm. In the near-by old
church his venturesome heart lay for long years. Now
only unlettered Indians crowd in and out of the place.
There is a huge adjacent seminary of the Spanish period,
unused since the “Laws of Reform.” The most
visible results of the “Laws of Reform” seem to be, as
far as I have discovered, huge, dusty waste spaces,
where schools had once been. All over Mexico there
are such.</p>

<p>Texcoco doesn’t offer many inducements to modern
picnickers, so we motored back a short distance and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
stopped at the hacienda of Chapingo, formerly belonging
to Gonsalez, President of Mexico before Diaz’s second
administration. <em>He</em> was allowed to leave the
country. As Dooley remarks, “There is no such word
as ‘ix-Prisidint’ in Mexico. They are known as ‘the late-lamented,’
or ‘the fugitive from justice’; and the only
tr’uble the country has with those who remain is to keep
the grass cut.”</p>

<p>Beautiful avenues of eucalyptus adorn the entrance
to the gaudy clap-clappy house, and the dozens of <i lang="es">peon</i>
dwellings surrounding it. The <i lang="es">administrador</i> allowed us
to have our luncheon in the grounds, and we sat around
the dry, flower-grown basin of an old fountain. Hay recited;
we picked bunches of violets without moving an
inch, and watched cheerful lizards darting in and out.
Coming home, great spiral pillars of dust reached up,
with a regular rotary motion, to the sky over the lake,
the results of the drainage works of the lake and valley
of Texcoco.</p>

<p>As we passed the <i lang="es">Peñon</i> and got into the straight home
road, some one remarked, “Nothing doing in the Zapatista
line this time.” A moment afterward, however, volleys
were heard in the direction of Xochimilco, and puffs
of smoke could be seen. Then about forty <i lang="es">rurales</i> galloped
up. The sergeant, a fresh-complexioned, dull-witted
fellow, stopped us and asked if we knew from
where the firing came. We apparently knew more than
he, little as it was. He continued, in a helpless way:
“Those are Mauser shots, <i lang="es">pero no hay tren, no hay telefono.
Como vamos a hacer?</i>” (“but we have no train, we
have no telephone. What are we to do?”) When we
asked him the name of the village (<i lang="es">pueblo</i>) where it
was going on, he shrugged his shoulders and answered,
“<i lang="es">Quién sabe?</i>” Finally we left the <i lang="es">rurales</i> to their own
devices and came upon a group of women running for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
their lives and virtue. They all learn to get out of the
way of the soldiers, as they are obliged to hear dreadful
<i lang="es">groserías</i>, if nothing worse. A pink- or blue-skirted figure
being chased in the maguey-fields is no uncommon
sight.</p>

<p>We came back to the Embassy and had tea, learning
that a huge fire we had seen burning on the side of a
not-distant hill, and which we thought might be from a
charcoal-burners’ camp, was a village the Zapatistas
had pillaged and set on fire at two o’clock, while we were
peacefully picnicking in “violet-crowned” Chapingo.</p>

<p>The Tozzers and Clarence Hay leave for Oaxaca and
Mitla, to-morrow night, for a week’s trip. I would have
loved to go, but “No traveling” is our motto. We must
keep out of possible troubles. Later Kanya de Kanya,
the new Austro-Hungarian minister, came to call. He
has been ten years in the Foreign Office in Vienna, and is
glad to be out of the turmoil of Near-East politics. For
him Mexico is relatively quiet. There are only about
five or six hundred of his nationals in the whole country,
as there has been little or nothing here for them since the
Maximilian tragedy. Kanya is a Hungarian. He will
be a pleasant colleague, and I certainly hope the Magyar
will show itself. He is said to be very musical.</p>

<p>In the evening Seeger came back for dinner; also Burnside,
who is up from Vera Cruz for a day or so. We had
a “political” evening. Going back over things, it does
seem as if the United States, in conniving at the elimination
of Diaz, three years ago, had begun the deadly
work of disintegration here.</p>

<p>But all the time I kept before my mind’s eye the
enchanting background of blue hills and lakes shining
in the slanting sun, millions of wild ducks flying across
the Lake of Chalco, and, above it, the smoldering village,
the reverberations of the Mauser rifles below!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span></p>


<h3><em>February 9th.</em></h3>

<p>There was a pleasant luncheon at the Lefaivres’ for
Kanya. They—the Lefaivres—are both worn out with
their long Mexican sojourn, five years, and the heavy
responsibilities entailed by the ever-increasing French
material losses, and are planning to go on leave in
March. They are good friends and I shall miss
them greatly, but I have learned to be philosophic
about partings. Life keeps filling up, like a miraculous
pitcher.</p>

<p>The newspapers have been getting the details of the
horrible disaster in the Cumbre tunnel in Chihuahua, a
few days ago. A bandit chief, Castillo, set fire to it by
running into it a burning lumber-train. A passenger-train
came along, collided with the débris, and all that
has been recovered is a few charred bones. It is near
the frontier, and it is said that Villa allowed the rescue-party
to have an escort of American soldiers. There
were a number of American women and children on the
train; but it is a momentous step—or may be—for
American troops to get into Mexico. Castillo did the
thing, it is said, to revenge himself on Villa. This latter
is getting a taste of the responsibilities success entails.
He has Chihuahua, and Juarez, and a long line of railway
to protect, and I am sure he doesn’t find guerilla warfare
a recommendable pastime, when it is directed
against himself and his ambitions.</p>


<h3><em>February 10th.</em></h3>

<p>This morning we went over the magnificent Buen Tono
cigarette-factories. Pugibet, who sold cigarettes in the
street forty years ago, is the founder and millionaire
owner. The factory is a model in all ways, and a testimony
to his brains, energy, and initiative. He showed
us over the vast place himself. In one of the rooms he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
had refrained from installing machinery, as it meant
taking work from hundreds of women.</p>

<p>Oh, the deftness and skill of those beautiful Indian
hands! Their motions were so quick that one hardly
saw anything but the finished article. He loaded us with
cigarettes and many souvenirs, and we drove home
after a visit to the big church he had built near by.
On arriving home, I found the words, “Papa,” “Mama,”
“Elim,” and “Kuss,” written in white chalk, in high
letters, on the entrance-door. I hated to have them
removed.</p>

<p>N. has protested to the Foreign Office regarding the
scurrilous language the <cite>Imparcial</cite> has used about the
President, the <cite>Imparcial</cite> being a government organ.
“Wicked Puritan with sorry horse teeth,” “Exotic and
nauseous Carranzista pedagogue,” are samples of its
style.</p>


<h3><em>Evening.</em></h3>

<p>I have had a stone for a heart all day, thinking of the
horrors that are to be multiplied. Nelson went to see
Gamboa this afternoon. Incidentally the raising of
the embargo was mentioned, and Gamboa said he
thought Huerta might declare war. Like all the rest,
he is doubtless ready to desert the old man. <i lang="fr">Après
moi le déluge</i> and “the devil take the hindmost” are the
sentiments governing people here. Mr. Jennings just
rang up to ask if we had heard that the letter-bag of the
Zapatistas had been seized. In it was a letter to President
Wilson from Zapata, saying he upheld and was
in perfect accord with his (Wilson’s) policy toward
Huerta. A smile on the face of every one!</p>

<p>I went to the Garcia Pimentels’ at four o’clock, where
we sewed till seven for the Red Cross. The women there
were all wives or daughters of wealthy <i lang="es">hacendados</i>.
They asked me if there was any news, and as usual,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
I answered, “Nothing new,” but I felt my eyes grow
dim. This measure will strike them hard. The <i lang="es">hacendados</i>
in this part of the country have made great sacrifices
to co-operate with the Federal government (it is
the only visible thing in the shape of government) in the
hope of preserving their properties and helping toward
peace.</p>

<p>There were crowds before the Church of the Profesa
in “Plateros” as I drove home. The church had been
gutted by fire the night before, its second misfortune
since we arrived. Its great dome was rent during the
terrific earthquake of the 7th of June, 1911—that unforgetable
day on which I saw Madero make his triumphant
entry into Mexico. At half past four in the
morning the town was rocked like a ship in a gale, with a
strange sound of great wind.</p>

<p>The Profesa, which has only just been repaired, was
built late in the sixteenth century, and was a center of
Jesuit activity. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries
all the great marriages, baptisms, and functions
took place in it. One can see in one’s mind the array of
proud viceroys and their jewel-decked spouses and all
the glittering functionaries, and last, but not least, the
inevitable accompaniment of the Indian population,
wandering in and out. Yesterday, at San Felipe, Mass
was celebrated by a priest with a pronounced Spanish
eighteenth-century ascetic face of the Merry del Val type.
As he turned to give the blessing, I thought of the many
elect and beautiful priests of Spain who had in bygone
days turned with that same gesture and expression to
give the same blessing to like throngs of uplifted Indian
faces. The Indians crowd the churches and I am thankful
that Heaven can be foreshown to them, somewhere,
somehow. They are but beasts of burden here below.</p>

<h3><em>February 12th.</em></h3>

<p class="dropcap">Sir Lionel Carden is leaving next week. He
feels (I think not without reason) very bitter about
his experience down here. He is going to London <i lang="la">via</i>
Washington. I suppose he means to tell the President
a lot of things, but when he gets there he won’t do it.
Something in the air will make him feel that nothing is
of any use....</p>

<p>The protest Nelson made to the Foreign Office over
the abusive language of the <cite>Imparcial</cite> was in big head-lines
in the newspapers yesterday. The Spanish language
lends itself exceedingly well to abuse. Miron, the
man who wrote the articles, now goes about declaring
that he will shoot Nelson at the first opportunity. I
don’t think anything will come of this, however, though
it keeps one a little uneasy in this land of surprises.</p>


<h3><em>February 13th.</em></h3>

<p>This morning we received a telegram that Nelson’s
father is seriously ill (pneumonia) and all day I have
been broken with agonies of indecision. Ought I to go
to New York, possibly in time to close those beautiful
old eyes? Or ought I to stay here?</p>

<p>N. intends to have six marines come up from Vera
Cruz. We could lodge them here. This house was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
built for two very large apartments and was joined by
doors and stairways when taken for an Embassy. The
very large dining-room on the bedroom floor could easily
hold six cots and the necessary washing apparatus. It
is now used as a trunk-room, pressing-room, and general
store-room. Personally I don’t feel that anything will
happen in Mexico City, beyond having a premonition
that we may be giving asylum to Huerta some of these
days. The scroll bearing his hour still lies folded upon
the lap of the gods.</p>


<h3><em>February 17th.</em></h3>

<p>I decided this morning not to go to New York, though
Berthe had my things in readiness for to-morrow night.
I was afraid that when I wanted to return I might not
be able to get up to the city from Vera Cruz.</p>

<p>I went to see von Hintze this morning about the circus
performance on Friday night for the Red Cross. He
had already sent out invitations for a big dinner for that
night, but he will postpone this until Saturday. He
thinks there will be trouble here, and <em>soon</em>, and that I
would never have time to go and return. So are destinies
decided. Suddenly it was clear to me that I was to stay
with my boy and Nelson and await results. Von Hintze
considers the situation desperate and has sent out a circular
telling his nationals to leave the country. In that
story, “Two Fools,” you will see some of the disadvantages
of leaving, faced by people whose all is here. Von
Hintze is having Maxim quick-firing guns up from Vera
Cruz. Three good mitrailleuses and the men to work
them would be ample protection for any of the legations
in case of riots.</p>

<p>Diaz Miron, who is threatening Nelson’s life, has already
killed three men. Another man he shot limps
about town, and he himself has a bad arm. He is a poet,
a neurotic, but wrote in his young days some of the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
beautiful Spanish verse that exists. Now he is old,
violent, and eccentric. I hardly think anything will come
of his threats. Huerta has other Diaz Mirons; he has
but one American <i lang="fr">chargé d’affaires</i>; and if necessary Diaz
Miron can be put in the <i lang="es">Penitenciaría</i> or Belem. I
only fear some fool may catch the idea and do what
Miron wouldn’t do.</p>

<p>A very nice cable came from Mr. Bryan this afternoon,
saying that the President was deeply concerned at the
threats against Nelson, and that we should arrange for
secret-service men to follow him when he goes out of
the Embassy; and also, if necessary, have a military
guard at the house. There has been a secret-service
man walking up and down outside for several days, and
a dull time he must be having.</p>

<p>The morning was soft, yet brilliant, when I walked
down to von Hintze’s. It seems strange that blood and
tragedy should be woven in such a beautiful woof. Von
Hintze is not an alarmist, but by telling me to go to New
York, on the theory that everybody that can should
leave, he certainly decided me to stay. I <em>can’t</em> be away
if anything happens here. So now I am calm again.
Having been ready to go, not dodging the hard duty,
makes me able to remain in peace.</p>


<h3><em>February 18th.</em></h3>

<p>We have a new Minister for Foreign Affairs, a gentleman,
to replace Moheno, the joyful bounder who has
been in during the past few months. Portillo y Rojas, the
new minister, is also supposed to be that white blackbird,
an honest man. He has held various public offices
without becoming rich, even when he was governor of
the State of Jalisco. He, like all the rest, however, will
do as Huerta dictates.</p>

<p>Maximo Castillo, the bandit responsible for the awful
Cumbre tunnel disaster, was captured by American<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
troops yesterday. Twenty-one Americans perished in
the disaster. I wonder what Washington will do with
him? To which of the two unrecognized governments
can he be turned over? He was making a big détour
around a mountain range, with a few followers, when he
was caught, trying to avoid Villa. This is another piece
of good luck for “the tiger.”</p>

<p>Huerta continues to believe in himself. N. says that
unless von Hintze had information of a precise nature
that Blanquet (Huerta’s intimate friend and his Minister
of War) is going to betray him, the end is by no
means in sight. But treachery is as much a part of this
landscape as the volcanoes are.</p>

<p>Had a wearing sort of day, full of corners and edges;
also the first real dust-storm of the season, which helps
to make nerves raw. The government sends down
three Gatling-guns, which Nelson is to get into the country
“anyway he thinks best.” It will not be a simple
matter. Everything is in a combustible condition here,
needing but a match to ignite the whole.</p>


<h3><em>Evening.</em></h3>

<p>Just returned from Chapultepec from Señora Huerta’s
reception. It was her first in two months, as she had
been in mourning for her brother. The “court” wore
black. I found myself next to Huerta for tea, having
been taken out by the Minister of Communicaciones—the
Minister of “Highways and Buyways,” he might
be called. I had a little heart-to-heart talk with the
President—unfortunately in my broken Spanish. He
gave me some flowers and all the good things on the
table, and in return I gave him a red carnation for his
buttonhole. He called for <i lang="es">enchiladas</i> and <i lang="es">tamales</i>—pink
jelly and fussy sandwiches don’t appeal to him—but
the majordomo, with a grin, said, “<i lang="es">No hay</i>.”</p>

<p>A few of the <i lang="fr">gens du monde</i> were there. It seems cruel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
for them to boycott their own government as they
continually and consistently do. Huerta has promised
to put a larger house at our disposition for the Red
Cross, and I begged him to come, if only for a moment,
to the benefit circus performance on Friday. He has
some military engagement for that night. I think we
will be able later to get up a really productive bull-fight
for the Red Cross, if he will sanction it. There is always
money for bull-fights in this country. If the bull-fighters
didn’t come so high, and if the bulls were not
so dear, a bull-fight would be a wonderful way of putting
any organization on its feet!</p>

<p>Huerta sat with Nelson the whole time after tea,
in the bedroom next to the big <i lang="fr">salon</i>, and Nelson
broached to him the subject of the guns. He said he
could bring in any blankety thing he pleased, or the
Spanish equivalent, but he warned him to do it quietly.
We were almost the last to leave and Huerta took me
on his arm down the broad, red-carpeted stairs, telling
me that Mexicans were the friends of everybody, and
offering me a pony for Elim. When we got to the glass
vestibule, in front of which the autos were waiting, he
made us take <em>his</em> auto. “<em>Your</em> automobile,” he insisted,
when I said, “Oh, but this is yours!” What could
I do but get in, to the salute of officers, our empty
car following us. All his courtesies make it a bit
hard for us. I felt like a vampire in a churchyard or
some such awful thing, when I was sitting there in the
big <i lang="fr">salon</i>, knowing that Huerta is up against the world
and can’t but slip at the end, no matter how he digs
in his feet. He needs fidelity. It is nowhere to be had,
and never was to be had in Mexico, if history is to be believed.
When Santa Ana left Mexico City with twelve
thousand troops in 1847 to meet and engage Scott at
Puebla, he finally arrived with a fourth of that number—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
others vanishing along the road a few at
a time.</p>

<p>There was a good deal of uniform up there this afternoon.
I looked at those gold-braided chests with mingled
feelings—pity at the thought of the uncertainty of life,
and a sickening feeling of the undependability of the
sentiments that fill them when the constitution is in
question.</p>

<p>We hear that Diaz Miron leaves for Switzerland to-night;
which, if true, ends <em>that</em> little flurry. The long
arm of the Dictator moves the puppets as he wills, and
I imagine he intends to take no risks concerning the brightest
jewel in his crown—<i lang="la">i. e.</i>, N., the last link with the
United States. I keep thinking what a “grand thing”
a dictatorship is if it is on your side. Most of the
dozen Huerta children were at the reception—from the
youngest, a bright little girl of seven, to the fatuous
eldest officer son of thirty or thereabouts. A big diamond
in a gold ring, next to a still bigger one in platinum,
were the most conspicuous things about him.</p>

<p>A new comic journal called <cite>Mister Lind</cite> made its first
appearance to-day. It is insulting and unclean, with a
caricature of Lind on the second page. I can’t decide
whether the name is bright or stupid.</p>

<p>The Mexicans are master-hands at caricature and
play upon words, and there are generally some really
trenchant political witticisms in their comic papers.
There are wishes for Wilson’s early demise scattered
through the pages in various forms. But I imagine they
are boomerang wishes, and the journal itself will have a
short and unprofitable life. The big middle page has
a picture, calling itself <i lang="es">El Reparto de Tierras</i> (“The Division
of Lands”). It represents a graveyard; underneath
are the words, “<i lang="es">tenemos 200,000 tierras tenientes</i>” (“we
have 200,000 landholders”)—a sad play upon the division<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
of lands. Above it vultures are portrayed, wearing
Uncle Sam’s hat. Another caricature shows the Mexicans
carrying a coffin labeled <i lang="es">Asuntos Nacionales</i> (National
Affairs), with President Wilson as a candle-bearer.
The press gets more anti-American every day.</p>

<p>On one of N’s visits to the President, at his famous
little shack-like retreat set in among a collection of
market-gardens, at Popotla, he began to talk about the
division of lands, saying the Indian had inalienable
rights to the soil, but that the lands should be returned
to him under circumstances of justice and order. On<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
no account should they be used as a reward for momentarily
successful revolutionaries. He added that the
United States had never respected the rights of their
Indians, but had settled the whole question by force.</p>


<h3><em>February 19th.</em></h3>

<p>We went this morning to the big military <i lang="fr">revue</i> at the
Condesa, one of the most beautiful race-tracks in the
world. I thought of Potsdam’s strong men under dull
skies. Now I am in this radiant paradise, watching more
highly colored troops, who make a really fine show, and
who perhaps are soon to fight with “the Colossus of the
North.” Certainly in another year many of them will
have been laid low by brothers’ hands. The President
was very pleased with the 29th, the crack regiment that
helped him to power a year ago. He addressed a few
words to them, and his hands trembled as he decorated
their flag, pinning the cross at the top of the flag-staff,
and attaching a long red streamer instead of the rosette
that generally goes with this decoration. They made a
fine showing, and the <i lang="es">rurales</i>, under command of Rincon
Gaillardo, on a beautiful horse, and in all the splendor of
a yellow and silver-trimmed <i lang="es">charro</i> costume, were a
picturesque and unforgetable sight. The <i lang="es">rurales</i> wear
great peaked hats, yellow-gray costumes made with the
tight <i lang="es">vaquero</i> trousers, short embroidered coats, and long,
floating red-silk neckties—such a spot at which to aim!
I suppose there were six or seven thousand troops in all.
Everything was very spick and span—men, horses, and
equipment. It was a testimony to Huerta’s military
qualities that in the face of his manifold enemies he
could put up such an exhibition. I sat by Corona, governor
of the Federal District, and watched the glittering
<i lang="fr">défilé</i> and listened to the stirring martial music. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
Mexicans have probably the best brass in the world—<i lang="fr">le
beau côté de la guerre</i>. But what horrors all that glitter
covers! Twice, when Huerta’s emotion was too much
for him, he disappeared for a <i lang="es">copita</i>, which was to be
had in a convenient back inclosure.</p>


<h3><em>Evening.</em></h3>

<p>I started out with Kanya and Madame Simon to motor
to Xochimilco, and before getting out of town we ran
down a poor <i lang="es">pelado</i>. It was a horrible sensation as the
big motor struck him. I jumped out and ran to him and
found him lying on his poor face, a great stream of blood
gushing from a wound in his head.</p>

<p>They wouldn’t let me touch him till a sergeant came.
Then we turned him on his back, and I bound up his
head as well as I could, with a handkerchief some one
gave me, and with one of my long, purple veils. I took
the motor—Kanya and Madame Simon are not used to
blood—and went quickly to the <i lang="es">comisaría</i> and got a
doctor. The chauffeur, whose fault it really was, was
trembling like an aspen. When we got back, it seemed
to me the whole <i lang="es">peon</i> world had turned out. Finally
we got the victim laid on the <i lang="es">camilla</i>; and now, I suppose,
his poor soul is with its Maker. As the motor is
Kanya’s, there will be no calling him up in court, and
he will be very generous to the family. I am thankful,
for various reasons, that it wasn’t the Embassy motor.
I am awfully upset about it; to think of starting out on
this beautiful afternoon and being the instrument to
send that poor soul into eternity.</p>

<p>Later I went to see Madame Lefaivre. She is in bed with
a “synovite,” and is trying to superintend her packing at
the same time. I met von Hintze as I came out of the
Legation. He informed me, with a wicked smile, that
the review was to celebrate, or rather, commemorate, the
mutiny of the celebrated Twenty-ninth against Madero
last February. Well, I hope we won’t get into trouble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
with the powers that be. He addressed me, saying, “I
hear you presided over the military commemoration of
to-day.”</p>

<p>I said, “Good heavens! <em>What</em> commemoration?” I
knew nothing of it, and was only interested to see what
sort of a showing the troops would make!</p>

<p>I write no more. I feel very <i lang="fr">triste</i> with the sight of
that poor, bleeding head before my eyes and the memory
of the impact of that body against the motor.</p>


<h3><em>February 20th.</em></h3>

<p>The poor man is still alive, but is going to die. The
curious thing about the fatality (which is the only word
for it) is that the man had just come from Querétaro,
where he had sold a house for 4,200 pesos, which he had
on him, and which were subsequently stolen from him
at the <i lang="es">policía</i>. I noticed that when he was put on the
stretcher his hand for a moment convulsively pressed
his belt. I suppose moving him brought a momentary
consciousness, and he thought weakly of his all. Doubtless
he was the only <i lang="es">pelado</i> in town that had that or <em>any</em>
amount on him. The chauffeur is in jail, and, after all,
Kanya will have a lot of trouble before the matter has
been arranged.</p>

<p>The comic journals of this week have just appeared.
All take a shot at Mr. Wilson for his recognition of Peru.
<cite>Multicolor</cite> has him, with a smile, handing the <i lang="es">Reconocimiento</i>
to Peru—a handsome young woman, representing
<i lang="es">la Revolución</i>—while with the other hand he tears the
map of Mexico from the wall.</p>

<p>The other day Nelson had a most interesting talk with
Huerta. He said he realized that the existence of any
government in Mexico without the good-will of the
United States was difficult, if not impossible; and that
he was deeply distressed that they did not take into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
account the manifold difficulties under which he was
laboring. It was at this interview that N. arranged the
question of getting in arms. Huerta pointed out that all
the requests N. had made him on behalf of the United
States had been granted, and that the entire Federal
army had been ordered to give special consideration to
Americans. He said that he did not desire to criticize
the government of the United States, but did wish to
point out that if it defeats him in pacifying the country
it will be forced into the difficult and thankless task of
armed intervention. He continued that, on looking at
the Mexican situation, one must not lose sight of the
fact that Mexico is an Indian country (mentioning
the difficulties <em>we</em> had had with our Indians); that
the Indian population here had been oppressed by the
Spaniards and the landowning classes for centuries; that
during the régime of Porfirio Diaz they had conceived
the desire for material betterment, but were given no
chance (the chances being for the few); that under the
régime of Madero the revolutionary habit became general,
as the sequel of unfulfillable promises. Also that the
present task in Mexico was not to establish a democracy,
but to establish order. He did not criticize the rebels of
the north, but said they would never, in the event of
victory, be able to establish a government in Mexico,
and that one of their first acts would be to turn against
the United States. From Maximilian to Huerta they
have all known our friendship is essential.</p>

<p>The Benton case is going to make an untold amount of
trouble, and the Mexican problem again comes into sight
from the international point. A life is worth a life, perhaps,
before God; but down here the murder of a wealthy
British subject is of more account than that of some poor
American or a thousand Mexicans. The best and most-to-be-believed
version of Villa’s shooting of him is that,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
on Benton’s expostulating with him about the confiscation
of his property in Chihuahua, he was shot, then and
there. That is the reason they have been unwilling to let
his wife have the body, which shows bullet-wounds in the
<em>wrong places</em>. Villa claims he was shot after a court-martial
had declared him guilty of an attempt on his, Villa’s
life. You can imagine a wealthy Britisher attempting
Villa’s life! All any foreigner up there wants is to be let
alone. Whatever the true history may be, there is intense
indignation on the frontier. Sir Cecil Spring-Rice
has made formal protestations to the State Department.
The English press is aroused, and it was told us by one
correspondent that Sir Edward Grey will be called on to
answer questions in Parliament. The fat is, at last, in
the fire.</p>

<p>Dr. Ryan returned yesterday, more or less discouraged
with his Washington trip. Everything for the
rebels. Mr. Lind is so fascinated by them that I understand
he is counseling direct financial aid—a loan. He
hasn’t perceived the shape and color of events here, but
has become obsessed by the idea of getting rid of Huerta.
That and his hallucination about Villa cover the whole
situation for him. What is to be done afterward if
Huerta is squeezed out? That is what we all want to
know—the afterward. One long vista of bloodshed and
heartbreak and devastation presents itself.</p>


<h3><em>February 22d.</em></h3>

<p>Elim has gone to his first and, I hope, his <em>last</em> bull-fight,
with Dr. Ryan. He has clamored so to go that I
finally yielded. I feel rather uncertain about it. There
was a very <i lang="fr">chic</i> dinner at von Hintze’s last night, for Sir
Lionel, who leaves on Wednesday. I feel awfully sorry
for him, but this Benton matter may be a justification,
to a certain extent. He says he is only to be gone six<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
weeks—but <i lang="es">quién sabe?</i> Hohler has arrived—a good
friend of ours. His are safe hands in which to leave
matters.</p>

<p>Nelson is busy getting one of the American correspondents
out of that terrible Belem. He has been put
in there with all those vermin-covered people, with their
typhoid and other germs, and must have had some bad
hours.</p>


<h3><em>February 24th.</em></h3>

<p>Just a line this morning. Am getting ready for my
American bridge party, with prizes, this afternoon. I
have some lovely large Ravell photographs in good old
frames.</p>

<p>Last night Patchin, the very agreeable young <cite>Tribune</cite>
correspondent, came for dinner; we had the usual
political conversation afterward. Clarence Hay read a
poem of his (which I will later inclose) on the murder of
young Gen. Gabriel Hernandez, last July, by Enrique
Zepeda, then governor of the Federal district. Zepeda is
called a “nephew” of Huerta, but is supposed to be his
son. Zepeda gave a supper to which N. was invited; at
the last moment, press of work made him unable to
assist. The gods were with him that time, for, after the
supper, at midnight, Zepeda, very much <i lang="fr">allumé</i>, went to
the <i lang="es">Penitenciaría</i> where General Hernandez was imprisoned,
took him out into the <i lang="es">patio</i>, and shot him dead.
His men then burned the body, over which they were
thoughtful enough to first pour kerosene. Zepeda was
put in jail for eight months, and is just out. When he
isn’t intoxicated he is almost “American” in his ideas,
it appears.</p>


<h3><em>Wednesday, February 25th.</em></h3>

<p>Last night we went to the station to see Sir Lionel off.
I thought the cheers that went up as the train moved
out of the station were for him, but it seems they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
were for some departing bull-fighters, who are always
first in the hearts of their countrymen. It appears that
Sir Lionel is carrying with him documents, plans, maps,
etc., with a collection of fully authenticated horrors committed
by the rebels in their campaign. He may not
get an opportunity of laying them before President Wilson,
but he will enjoy showing them to Sir Cecil Spring-Rice.</p>

<p>Yesterday, from the governor’s palace in Chihuahua,
Villa gave forth a statement about the killing of
Benton. He was seated on a throne-like chair on a
raised dais, in almost regal style, his followers surrounding
him and doing him homage. The gubernatorial palace
is fitted up with the greatest luxury, the houses of the
wealthiest residents of the town having been sacked for
the purpose. Consider the picture of that untutored,
bloody-handed brigand, surrounded by his spoils and
his “courtiers.” He has never heard how “uneasy lies
the head that wears a crown,” but he will doubtless have
some practical experience of it. He has contradicted
himself repeatedly in his statements about the killing of
Benton. The body, bearing its mute testimony of being
riddled with bullets by a firing-squad, lies under a heap
of refuse.</p>

<h3><em>February 26th. Noon.</em></h3>

<p class="dropcap">We are just home, after seeing the review (from
Chapultepec through town to the <i lang="es">Zocalo</i>) of all the
troops now in the city. They were turned out for the
benefit of the special correspondents, invited to the gay
scene by Huerta, and the government is paying all
the expenses. The regular correspondents in town
feel rather peeved about the matter. We sat in the
motor in the <i lang="es">Zocalo</i>, under the cloudless sky and soft,
penetrating sun, and watched the <i lang="fr">défilé</i>. The banner of
the Twenty-ninth bore the long, red streamer that
Huerta had tied on the other day, with trembling fingers.
The troops were all well armed. They had new rifles
and new, well-filled cartridge-belts, and the effect was
most encouraging—for <i lang="es">Huerta</i>. The special correspondents,
from the windows of the Palace, had their cameras
and cine machines in action. Really, Huerta has done
wonders to keep the troops together so well and so long,
in the face of such overwhelming odds. The bugle-calls
and the martial music echoed over the Plaza—the setting
for so many centuries of the hopes and fears, the beginnings
and the endings, of these Mexican people.</p>

<p>I thought of the 1911 anniversary of the <i lang="es">Grito de
Dolores</i>—that night of the 16th of September when I
stood on the middle balcony of the <i lang="es">Palacio</i>, with de la<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
Barra and Madero, when the former was still President
<i lang="la">ad interim</i>, and the latter was hoping all things. There
we looked down on fifty or sixty thousand upturned
faces, while the celebrated <i lang="es">Campana de la Independencia</i>
(Independence bell) rang above our heads, followed by
the great bells from the illuminated towers of the
cathedral. The present is nearer the past in Mexico
than anywhere else.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> As we came home we were
snapshotted a dozen times by the disconsolate correspondents
who had not been invited to the Palace
to “assist” at the parade. Coming up “Plateros,”
Nelson saw Huerta’s automobile outside of “El Globo”
restaurant, and left me, to go in to speak to him.</p>

<p>This morning the big banana-tree in the front garden
was released from its winter wrappings, if one can call
these cloudless days winter. The most wonderful banners
of purest, palest yellow are gently waving against
the perfect sky. I am now waiting for Hohler to come
to lunch. Sir Lionel went off (during a tremendous
<i lang="es">norte</i>), in the battle-ship <em>Essex</em>, which is taking him to
Galveston. His country is treating him almost to the
honors we give fleeing Maderistas.</p>

<p>Villa has not yet given up the body of Benton. If
there is much more delay it will not be able to bear
testimony to the truth. Unfortunately, a Federal officer,
it is rumored, has hanged an American citizen, Vergara,
at Piedras Negras. His pardon, sent from headquarters,
came too late. Huerta will probably make an
example of the hasty officer, if the deed has really been
committed. We heard this morning that Carranza is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
going to make short work of O’Shaughnessy when <em>he</em>
gets here. When!</p>

<p>I had a very interesting conversation with Hohler,
who is thoroughly sincere and trustworthy, and able to
look at things as they are. We sat long over our coffee,
talking of the international web, of which Mexico is now
so uncertain and frail a mesh. He intends to do what
he can for <em>his</em> nationals. He is without fear, in a practical,
unnervous way.</p>

<p>The reverse of the medal is that he is a tireless collector
and connoisseur of beautiful things, and what he
doesn’t get, the Belgian minister does. Between them,
there is very little left for anybody else.</p>


<h3><em>February 27th.</em></h3>

<p>Villa is still refusing to deliver up the body of Benton,
even at the risk of offending the United States. Huerta
expects Villa to hang himself with his own rope. He says
he is a <i lang="es">tonto</i>, violent, undisciplined, and <em>can’t</em> do what he
ought. The rumors that he is refusing to receive orders
from Carranza are taking more explicit shape. He says
that Carranza has never once put himself in danger;
that he (Villa) has done all; that he receives commands
from no one. He has repeatedly and vainly been asked
to go to confer with Carranza, and we now hear that
the mountain of all constitutional virtues is going to
Mohammed. The deadly wine of success is mounting
to Villa’s head. He now has wealth to the extent of
some millions of pesos. The Torreon and Chihuahua
confiscations were enormous, not counting what he and
his followers have taken in all the small towns looted.
He has not the sense to perceive in what difficulties his
killing of Benton has placed the people who are anxious
to be his friends. He evidently thinks that a man who
cannot write or read must “make his mark” in other
ways.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span></p>

<p>Our Gatling-guns, with ammunition, are arriving to-day
in Vera Cruz, by the Ward Line steamer. They are
to be got up here under the head of Embassy supplies—stationery,
and the like. Huerta knows they are, but
wants the thing done in a manner that he can wink at.
The “stationery” will weigh tons.</p>


<h3><em>February 28th.</em></h3>

<p>Elim had his curls shockingly cut this morning, but
his bang has been left. He is as proud as a puppy with
two tails. The “crime” was committed by a soft-speaking
Haitian barber, who won’t get another chance
at my only child. Elim knows nothing of death and dissolution;
has been calling “<em>Mima</em>,” all over the house, and
has just dashed into the drawing-room, where I am writing,
to ask for a trumpet. He is so clever about music
that I am almost tempted to sacrifice every one in the
house and get him one. He will soon be playing the
national air.</p>

<p>Yesterday I had tea with Madame B. She was looking
very handsome, lying among her costly blue-ribboned
laces. The baby, born ten days ago, looks like
a miniature “conqueror,” with its severe Spanish
features and glossy black hair. Madame B.’s father,
who is one of the wealthiest <i lang="es">hacendados</i>, spoke with
Huerta for the first time several weeks ago at the
Jockey Club. The President asked him, “How are
matters in Morelos?” (The Zapatista country where
they have immense sugar haciendas.) Don. L. answered,
“You are killing us with your demands for contributions.”
Huerta grew rather excited. “You do nothing
for the country,” he declared, “neither you nor your
sons.” Don L. answered, “I have lost one and a half
millions in the past year.” “Lucky man to have it to
lose,” commented Huerta, grimly. “Great sugar crops
are now ready for harvesting, but I can get no men,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
Don L. went on; “they are all in the army. Give me
men and I will give you contributions.”</p>

<p>Huerta immediately sent the men needed, the sugar is
being harvested, and Don L. feels convinced that Huerta
is doing what he can; but his daughter, who told me all
this, added, with a smile and flash of white teeth, “Pardon
me; but what <em>can</em> we do with your Mr. Wilson on
our backs?”</p>


<h3><em>Evening.</em></h3>

<p>We have had such a day of agitation. Telegrams from
New York tell us that Nelson’s father has received the
last sacraments. We have telegraphed to Vera Cruz to
know if one of the smaller fast ships is in the harbor.
I might go in it to New Orleans and thence by rail to
New York—in all seventy-eight or eighty hours from
Vera Cruz. Berthe has been packing my things. I
know lives must end, but my heart is very sad.</p>

<p>I kept my engagement to take the Russian and Austrian
ministers out to Tozzer’s Aztec diggings. Their
governments have subscribed money for archæological
work in Mexico (I have never <em>quite</em> understood why),
and Tozzer was most anxious to have them see what he
had done. We had tea, and <i lang="es">regalitos</i> of heads of idols,
dug up on the spot—spontaneously offered, this time.
There was a dust-storm blowing—the volcanoes were
invisible—and things were generally gritty. All the time
my thoughts were turning toward the life-and-death
issue, and I was so anxious to get home.</p>

<p>The Lefaivres leave definitely on the 12th. The Legation
is dismantled, and Madame Lefaivre is still lying
with her knee in plaster. Their secretary and his wife
naturally see them leave with mixed feelings. We all
know how <em>that</em> is, for what greater benefit can a chief bestow
than absence? Madame Lefaivre said to the
secretary: “What if the ship doesn’t sail on the 12th?”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
He made the most polite of disclaimers, but she answered,
smilingly, “Oh, I know the hearts of secretaries!”</p>


<h3><em>March 1st.</em></h3>

<p>I have just come from Mass, wondering how it is with
the soul and body of Nelson’s father....</p>

<p>This morning Washington must be thinking “how
sharper than a serpent’s tooth”! Carranza and Villa are
defying the supreme powers. They even deny our rights
to ask information regarding Benton, who, they say, is a
British subject—adding that they will listen to only such
representations as are made to them by Great Britain herself
“through the proper diplomatic channels.” No one
knew any such channels existed. They add, further,
that this ruling applies to other nations desiring redress
for their people. The Frankenstein monster is certainly
growing. Carranza also says that he has already investigated
the Benton affair, but only for use in case
Great Britain desires to take up the matter with him
as head of the revolution. The matter of Gustav Bauch,
American citizen, he will be kind enough to discuss with
Mr. Bryan, stating that he “greatly laments his death.”
This turn is most unexpected, though Villa and Carranza
were very uppish several months ago when
William Bayard Hale was sent to treat with them.
Now that the embargo is lifted, their arrogance knows
no bounds.</p>

<p>Vergara, the <em>supposed</em> American citizen, <em>supposed</em> to
have been put to death at Piedras Negras by a Federal
officer, and whose death so greatly outraged Washington,
has simply escaped and rejoined the rebel forces. It appears,
on investigation, that he was the chief of a gang of
eighteen bandits, and his occupation was the getting in
of arms and ammunition across the border for the rebels,
or the driving of large herds of stolen cattle over to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
American side. The Federals would have had a perfect
right to shoot him.</p>

<p>Yours of January 31st, understanding all so deeply,
says nothing of my typewritten letter about the Vera
Cruz trip. It must be a relief to you to get a legible
letter. McKenna, N.’s new young secretary, discreet and
competent, copied it for me.</p>

<p>Your report of having seen a statement in the newspapers
about “rushing the troops up to Mexico” reminds
me of a correspondent of one of the big New
York newspapers. He appeared here the other day,
saying he had been sent hurriedly to Vera Cruz on inside
information from Washington to be ready to go up
to Mexico City with the troops.</p>

<p>Last night Huerta, in view of the safety of his crown
jewel—<i lang="la">i. e.</i>, Nelson—said he was going to send a guard to
the Embassy. There was an <i lang="es">equivocación</i> (there always
<em>is</em> some mistake in Mexico) and an armed guard of eight
was sent to the American Club, a place Nelson rarely
goes to. About half past nine we had excited telephone
calls that the Club was guarded by these soldiers, as
riots were evidently feared by the authorities. The
newspaper men sent telegrams about it to New York,
but it was simply a case of going to the wrong place.
This morning four soldiers with rifles appeared as permanent
“guests,” but we don’t need them. We have
nice old Francisco and the new young <i lang="es">gendarme</i>, Manuel,
who was added some months ago. Each legation here
has one guard. I am glad to have Francisco and Manuel,
on Elim’s account. They always seem to know just
what he is doing in the garden.</p>

<p>We were so thankful to see, in one of the newspapers,
the head-line, “Huerta snubs O’Shaughnessy.” Of course
it isn’t true, but it will make an excellent impression at
home; and it may even give N.’s first-hand, accurate information<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
about matters some weight. The same newspaper
also shows a picture of Huerta at some charity performance
with his wife and daughters and Naranjo,
Minister of Public Instruction. He looks (and doubtless
felt) the personification of boredom. The head-lines
are, “Huerta enjoying social life while riots rage in
capital.”</p>


<h3><em>March 2d.</em></h3>

<p>Your letter of the 5th, sent after the raising of the embargo,
is received. I can well understand your worrying
about our remaining in Mexico. We worried for a few
minutes, but by now you will have received my letter
telling all about it. It will take something gigantic,
something outside of Huerta, to cause him to give Nelson
his passports, no matter how often fiery, enraged Cabinet
Ministers may urge it.</p>

<p>Last night, on returning home, we found that Huerta
had sent us six more soldiers with a sergeant. It made me
feel as if the house were the setting for an act from some
<i lang="fr">opéra bouffe</i>. We gave the soldiers packages of cigarettes
and a drink apiece, and I suppose they rested on the
sofas or floors of the parterre. N. never leaves the
house without his secret-service man, a decent fellow,
but dressed to the rôle in a loud, tight, bright-blue
suit with white stripes, and pistols—the last articles
outlined against his person every time he makes a
motion. We have a beautiful new motor—low, smooth-running,
painted black, with a smart dark-gray band
about it. He occupies the seat beside Jesus, gets out
when N. gets out, and waits around ostentatiously while
N. attends to whatever he has on hand. He is an awful
bore, and quite unnecessary, but Huerta answered, when
N. protested, “<i lang="es">Es mejor</i>” (“It is better so”).</p>

<h3><em>March 4th. Afternoon.</em></h3>

<p class="dropcap">Last night we received the news that Nelson’s father
was indeed approaching his mortal end. This morning,
at seven o’clock, after a sleepless night of “vanishings
and finalities,” I went down-stairs in answer to a
telephone call from Mr. Jennings, of the Hearst newspapers—who
is always very nice about everything—to
say that he had passed away peacefully at half past six.
You know the days of death—how strained, how busy,
how exhausting. The first thing I did was to go to
Father Reis, at San Lorenzo, the San Sylvester of Mexico,
and arrange for a requiem Mass on Saturday next,
the 7th, to which we will invite the Cabinet, the <i lang="fr">Corps
Diplomatique</i>, and friends. Now I am at home again, in
the mourning garments I wore for my precious brother.</p>


<h3><em>March 4th. Evening.</em></h3>

<p>The house seems very quiet to-night. No more looking
for telegrams. He is lying on his death-bed, looking very
handsome, I know. The fatigue of the busy, aching day
is on me. Many people have been here to-day to tender
their sympathies. Hohler, the last, came in for tea after
seeing Nelson, and has just gone.</p>

<p>Now the pouch is closed and everybody and everything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
has departed. Elim is lying on the floor in front
of my little electric stove. The chords so strongly moved
by the passing of my beloved brother are vibrating again,
not alone because of death and parting, but because of
life and the imperfections of its relationships. Nelson
has accepted his father’s death, has pulled himself together,
and is going on with his work, of which there is
more than sufficient.</p>

<p>How true it is that men follow their destinies rather
than their interests; a something innate and unalterable
drives each one along. <i lang="es">Genio y figura hasta la sepultura</i>—a
Spanish saying to the effect that mind, temperament,
inclination, are unchanged by the circumstances of life,
even to the grave.</p>


<h3><em>March 5th.</em></h3>

<p>As I was reading last night, waiting for dinner to be
served, a visitant, rather than a visitor, appeared in my
drawing-room <i lang="la">incognito</i>—a simple “Mr. Johnson,” eager,
intrepid, dynamic, efficient, unshaven!...</p>

<p>Young Terrazas, the son of the former great man of
Chihuahua, of whom I wrote you when first he was captured
by Villa at the taking of Chihuahua, several
months ago, has not yet been released, and Villa threatens
to execute him to-morrow if the half-million of ransom
money is not forthcoming. The father has raised,
half the sum, with the greatest difficulty, but, fearing
some trick (and he has every reason for distrust), he
won’t give the money till he receives his son. It appears
the son has been horribly treated, several times hung up
until he was nearly dead, then taken down and beaten.
Young Hyde, of the <cite>Mexican Herald</cite>, said yesterday,
apropos of like matters, that he had seen a man brought
last night to Mexico City who had been tortured by the
rebels; the soles of his feet were sliced off, his ears and
tongue were gone, and there were other and nameless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
mutilations, but the victim was still living. The only
difference between the rebels and the Federals is that
the former have <i lang="fr">carte blanche</i> to torture, loot, and kill,
and the Federals <em>must</em> behave, to a certain extent,
whether they want to or not. It is their existence that
is at stake. Huerta, though he may not be troubled
with scruples or morals other than those that expediency
dictates, has his prestige before the world to uphold, and
is sagacious enough to realize its value. The rebels go
to pieces as soon as there is any question of government
or order. Villa is without doubt a wonderful bandit, if
bandits are what the United States are after. I see by
the newspapers that Mr. Bryan is begging the Foreign
Relations Committee to keep the Mexican situation off
the floor of Congress....</p>

<p>One by one, the Mexicans to whom we have given
asylum and safe-conducts to Vera Cruz, upon receiving
their word of honor not to intrigue against the government,
break that word and go over to the rebels. We
have just seen the name of Dr. Silva (formerly governor
of Michoacan, whom we had convoyed to Vera Cruz) as
one of the somewhat tardy commission appointed by
Carranza to investigate the murder of Benton.</p>

<p>We are aghast at the resignation of Mr. John Bassett
Moore as counselor to the State Department. He is
learned, perfectly understanding, and very experienced
in a practical way about Latin-American affairs.</p>

<p>Yesterday the Minister for Foreign Affairs came to
present his condolences to Nelson, and also to protest
against the bringing up to the Embassy of our Gatling-guns
and ammunition, which are still in the customs at
Vera Cruz. There are seventy cases—and <em>not</em> featherweights.
He fell over the threshold, as he entered, and
was picked up by Nelson and the butler. (It was his
first visit. I don’t know if he is superstitious.) Huerta,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
as you may remember, in the famous bedchamber conversation
at Chapultepec, had told Nelson he could get
in all the guns he wanted, but to do it quietly. It is
now all over the country and is making a row among
Mexicans. In these days of grief and agitation, N. has
happened to have an unusual amount of official work.</p>

<p>I have been busy all day with the list for to-morrow’s
requiem Mass, and it is almost finished. My little Shorn
Locks has gone up-stairs, and I am resting myself by
writing these lines to you.</p>


<h3><em>March 7th.</em></h3>

<p>We are waiting to start for the church. You will
know all the thoughts and memories that fill my heart—that
descent from fog-enveloped hills into the cold,
gray town to lay away my precious brother. Now I am
about to start through this shimmering, wondrous morning
to the black-hung church. In the end it is all the
same.</p>


<h3><em>March 9th.</em></h3>

<p>I have not written since Saturday morning, before
starting to the requiem Mass. I have been so busy seeing
people and attending to hundreds of cards, telegrams,
and notes. Huerta did not appear at the church,
as people thought he might do. Instead, Portillo y Rojas,
the Minister for Foreign Affairs, sat by us. All was
beautiful and sad. Afterward we went into the sacristy
to receive the condolences of our friends, as is the custom
here. Though <em>he</em> had never trod the threshold of our
Mexican dwelling, it still seemed inexpressibly empty
as we returned to it. I was glad of the heaped-up desk
and the living decisions awaiting N.</p>

<p>Huerta was very nice on seeing him to-day, called him
“<i lang="es">hijo</i>” (“son”), gave him an affectionate <i lang="es">abrazo</i>, and all
his sympathy. Subsequently, Nelson had a long talk with
him in a little private room of the Café Colon, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
Huerta approached from the back entrance. Huerta is
broad in his ideas and very careful as to any remarks
about the United States, in Nelson’s presence. He always
speaks of President Wilson as <i lang="es">Su Excelencia, el Señor
Presidente Wilson</i>; there are no diatribes of any
kind. The thing that has really got on his nerves is our
keeping his 4,000 soldiers at Fort Bliss and expecting
him to pay for them. He says Mexico is not at war with
the United States; that the rebels are allowed to go and
come as they please, and even to organize on the frontier.
Why this discrimination? He says that our government
thinks he is a bandit, like Villa, but that if Washington
would be just it would see that he keeps his mouth
shut, does his work as well as he can in the face of the
terrible injustice done him, and asks nothing of any one
except to be let alone; that he could have had the power
in Mexico long before he took it. He repeated that many
a person of influence had urged him to put an end to
the disastrous Madero administration; that he is not in
politics for personal ends; that his wants are few, his
habits those of an old soldier. He always insists that
he did not kill Madero....</p>

<p>As for that, one can talk for hours and hours with all
sorts of people without finding any direct evidence of
any direct participation by Huerta in the death of
Madero. I have come to think it an inexcusable and
fatal negligence on his part, incidental to the excitement
and preoccupation of those tragic days. He was astute
enough to have realized that Madero dead would be even
more embarrassing to him than living, and should have
insisted on asylum for him where alone it was to be had.
There is, however, at times a strange suspension of
mental processes in Mexico; with everything possible
and yet nothing appearing probable, nobody ever foresees
any situation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span></p>

<p>I had a long call yesterday from Rincon Gaillardo,
Marqués de Guadalupe, the smart, youngish general.
Besides his military work, he is doing something that all
the members of the upper class should co-operate in—<i lang="la">i. e.</i>,
helping to amalgamate the classes. His father,
Duca de Regla and “Grand d’Espagne,” was the first man
in society here to receive Diaz when he came to power.
In fact, in his house Diaz met Doña Carmen. He told me
that Diaz wasn’t then, by any means, the kind of man
he is now, after thirty years of power and knowledge.</p>

<p>Last night, at midnight, Nelson, who had gone
to sleep early, was called down-stairs by urgent telephone
messages, to hear that the Texas Rangers had
dashed over the border to Sabinas Hidalgo to recover the
body of the pseudo-American cattle-rustler, Vergara.
Whether the report is true is not known, but of course
it is an act that would be resented by all classes here, and
every class really hates us.</p>

<p>Villa, not being able to get the full amount of the
ransom out of Terrazas <i lang="es">père</i>, has decided not to execute
the son, but to take him with him when he besieges
Torreon, and to place him wherever the bullets are thickest.
The mad dance of death goes on, and I feel as if
we were the fiddlers. Mr. Lind has so idealized the
rebels in the north that he has come to think them
capable of all the civic virtues, and he is obsessed by the
old tradition of north beating south whenever there is
an issue. His deduction is not borne out by facts, as in
Mexico it is the south that has produced the greatest
number of great men—“the governmental minds”; the
south has come nearer to loving peace; the south has
shown the greatest degree of prosperity and advancement.
Vera Cruz is the poorest possible vantage-ground
for a study of conditions; it is a clearing-house
for malcontents of all kinds, mostly rebels, fleeing from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
the consequences of <em>some</em> act against <em>some</em> authority.
My heart is heavy at the grim fatality that has permitted
our policy to be shaped <em>from there</em>.</p>

<p>A dust-storm this afternoon, with all the color gone
out of the air, and a few thick drops of cold rain. I
left cards for an hour or two, then came home. I am
glad to be here in my comfortable home, though I can’t
help a shiver as I think of the horrors sanctioned, even
encouraged, by us on every side. B. said once that
the policy of the United States in lifting the embargo
was to really give Mexicans a taste of civil war! There
were some chirpings from Carranza the other day, to the
effect that “I understand Villa, and Villa understands
me.” Doubtless this is true; but they say that after
their rare meetings the old gentleman has to go to bed
for several days.</p>

<p>I have just been reading an article by Mr. Creelman
on Lind. He has caught the spirit of Vera Cruz and
described exactly Mr. Lind and his <i lang="es">ambiente</i> there. He
speaks of him as “Mr. Wilson’s cloistered agent.” “In
a small, dark room with a red-tiled floor, opening on a
shabby Mexican courtyard,” he adds, “in the rear of the
American Consulate in Vera Cruz, sits John Lind, the
personal representative of the President of the United
States, as he has sat for seven months, smilingly watching
and waiting, while Mexico and her 15,000,000 men,
women, and children have moved to ruin.” It makes me
“creepy,” it is so true!</p>


<h3><em>March 10th, 5</em> <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span></h3>

<p>I am back from saying good-by to dear Madame Lefaivre;
she starts off to-night with swollen foot and leg,
and I am very much fearing the long voyage for her.
With her usual good nature she had had her paint-box
unpacked and was sitting on a trunk, putting some restoring
touches to a Madonna of most uncertain value,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
just discovered by the German consul-general. The
Lefaivres have a <i lang="fr">pied-à-terre</i> in Paris, with beautiful
things inherited from Madame Lefaivre’s father. Lefaivre
has decided to go, if the heavens fall, and, as we
laughingly told him, if his wife falls, too, for that matter.
I besought him to delay, for political reasons, but the
long sojourn is on his nerves, and he has a bad throat.
I am sorry to see them go, on my own account—such
good friends. I am writing this, expecting Hohler and a
woman special correspondent for tea. Burnside tells me
she has been in many storm-centers and is bright and
discreet.</p>


<h3><em>March 11th.</em></h3>

<p>N. is pretty hot about the arms which are in the customs
here in Mexico City. The officials keep him running
from one to the other; they don’t really want us to
have them, though the French, German, English, and
Japanese legations have long since been well stocked.
I came down-stairs to hunt for literature, about four
o’clock this morning, and heard the “Pretorian guard”
in the parterre, laughing and joking, as guards in all
ages have done. There are unlimited cigarettes and limited
<i lang="es">pulque</i> to make their watch easy.</p>


<h3><em>Later.</em></h3>

<p>We hear that Mr. Lind is having parleyings with the
Zapatistas! If he is going to dream this dream and
pass it on to his friends in Washington, they will all
have the most awful nightmare ever visited on
dreamers. Zapata has been the terror of every President—Diaz,
de la Barra, Madero, and Huerta—for
nearly five years. His crimes and depredations are committed
under the banner of “Land for the People,” and
there has been a certain consistency about his proceedings,
always “agin the government”; but that he has,
after these years of bloodshed, rapine, and loot, rendered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
conditions more tolerable for any except the rapers and
looters, is most debatable. I once saw some <em>living</em> remains
brought to the Red Cross after one of his acts at
Tres Marias, about fifty kilometers from here. A train
was attacked, looted, oil was poured on the passengers,
and the train was set on fire. The doctors who went to
the station to get the remains out of the train say the
sight was unforgetable. The name Zapata has now become
a symbol of brigandage, and many operate under
it. No general sent into Morelos has ever brought order.
For instance, one was sent to Michoacan with two thousand
cavalry, to put down a small force of several
hundred brigands; though he had the grazing free, he
charged the government 50 centavos per horse! It became
a vicious, but profitable, circle, as you can well see.</p>

<p>There has been a great break in exchange. The peso,
which was two to one when we first came to Mexico, and
lately has been three to one, or nearly that, broke Saturday,
and went to four and a half to the gold dollar.
Various explanations. Huerta has been threatening to
found a bank of his own if the bankers did not do something
for him. Some say that the bankers brought on the
break in exchange to scare him, and others that Huerta
proposed establishing a bank of his own to scare them!
Anyway, exchange broke. During his conversation with
the bankers, apropos of the loans they were loath to give
him, Huerta is said to have jocularly remarked that
there were trees enough in Chapultepec Park to hang
them all on without crowding. Those old cypresses
have witnessed a good deal, but a consignment of indigenous
and foreign bankers hanging with the long, gray
moss from their branches would have savored of novelty.</p>

<p>A gusty day on this usually wind-still plateau. The
pale yellow streamers of the banana-tree are torn to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
tatters, but one must forgive an occasional vagary in
this climate, unsurpassed in its steady beauty, and which
has the further recommendation that one can count on
wearing one’s winter clothes in summer, and one’s summer
clothes in winter....</p>

<p>Disorder here has been most prejudicial to French
interests. Since Maximilian’s time, especially, they have
had the habit of investments in Mexico. Now billions
of francs are unproductive. It will be a fine bill poor
old Uncle Sam will get from <i lang="fr">la belle</i> France!</p>


<h3><em>7.30.</em></h3>

<p>My callers are all gone, and Elim is playing bull-fight
with a red-velvet square from one of the tables, talking
Spanish to himself and making every gesture of his game
true to life. I am thankful the bull-fight season is over.
No more doleful-faced servants of a Sunday, heartbroken,
like children, because they are not swelling the
gay throng passing the Embassy to the Ring, and making
me feel like a wretch because they aren’t <em>all</em> there.</p>

<p>Nelson went down to try to look at his guns, presumably
at the customs. At least, he is as near as that,
with ears full of promises.</p>

<p>A telegram from Aunt L. says she starts up from the
Hot Country in a day or two. I am having the lovely
corner room next mine made ready for her.</p>


<h3><em>March 14th.</em></h3>

<p>We learn that the guns and ammunition supposed to
be got in <em>quietly</em>, as Embassy stores, bore on the invoice
the name of the colonel in charge at the Springfield
arsenal. Hence these tears! They are now reposing in a
deserted church near the military station, outside the
city. There would have been no trouble had they been
sent as Nelson requested. Now endless runnings are
necessary.</p>

<p>My house is overrun with children. They tell me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
it looks like an orphanage, at the back. Such nice,
little, bright-eyed Aztecs. In this stricken land how
can I deny shelter and food to little children who are,
so to speak, washed up at my door? The cook has three,
the washerwoman two, and the chambermaid is going
to present us with another. <i lang="fr">La recherche de la paternité</i>
shows the responsible person to have been our quiet,
trusty messenger, Pablo. I will deduct ten pesos a month
from his wages for six months—a salutary <i lang="es">proclama</i> to
everybody else of my sentiments. I will send her to the
hospital, and she will soon be back. The washerwoman
has just borrowed ten dollars to change her lodgings, as
the <i lang="es">leva</i> are after her husband. I sometimes feel like one
of the early friars. Nothing that is Indian is foreign
to me.</p>

<p>Last night Dr. Ryan was telling us, after dinner
(Patchin, who is returning to New York, also was here),
of the killing of Gustavo Madero, of which he was an
eye-witness and concerning whose death so many versions
are current. Shortly after one o’clock, on going
back to the Ciudadela, where Felix Diaz was quartered,
to attend to wounded who had been brought in, Ryan
encountered Madero being brought out with a guard
of twelve men. Diaz didn’t want him there, saying he
was not his prisoner, but Huerta’s. Madero was gesticulating
in a hysterical manner and waving his arms in
the air. As Ryan afterward learned, he was offering
the guards money if they would see him safely out of
town. His nerve seemed suddenly to leave him and he
began to run, whereupon one of the guards fired, hitting
him in the eye as he turned his head to look behind him.
The other eye was glass. This gave rise afterward to
stories that his eyes had been gouged out. On his continuing
to run, the whole guard fired at him, and he fell,
riddled with bullets. Ryan afterward examined the body<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
and found ten or twelve wounds. It all took place in
the little park before the Ciudadela. This is the authentic
account, and at least we know that Huerta was
in no way responsible for <em>his</em> death. Doubtless had
Gustavo kept his nerve, instead of trying to run, he
would be alive to-day. He was an awful bounder, but
had qualities of vitality, intellect, and a certain animal
magnetism. His is the famous remark that “out of a
family of clever men, the only fool was chosen for President.”
He wasn’t more than thirty-five or thirty-six, and
<em>loved</em> life. He had a power of quick repartee, a glancing
eye, and hands seeking treasure. Well, that is all
over, but it remains part of the unalterable history of
Mexico. Poor, revolution-ridden Mexico! Everybody
here has been one kind, generally two kinds, of revolutionist.
Huerta served under Diaz, was gotten rid of,
and served under Madero, whom he got rid of. Orozco
was the friend of Madero against Diaz, then against
Madero under Huerta, and so it goes. The history
of almost every public man shows like changes of banner,
and as for revolution <em>fomenters</em>, the United States
have certainly played a consistent and persistent
rôle for three years, outdone by no individual or faction
<em>here</em>.</p>

<p>I shall never forget my first experience of Latin-American
revolutions. It was a beautiful May afternoon,
now nearly three years ago, when a howling mob
of several thousands went through the streets, shouting
“Death to Diaz!” finally collecting in the <i lang="es">Zocalo</i> under
the windows of the apartment in the Palacio Nacional,
where Diaz was lying with a badly ulcerated tooth and
jaw. Two days later, in the wee, small hours, the once-feared,
adored, all-powerful, great man of Mexico, with
the immediate members of his family, was smuggled on
board a train secretly provided by Mr. Brown, under the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
escort of Huerta, and was taken to Vera Cruz. From
there he embarked on the <em>Ypiranga</em>, to join other kings
in exile, having said good-by, probably forever, to the
land of his triumphs and glories. It was touch and go
with <em>him</em> during those days, and he had created modern
Mexico out of blood and chaos.</p>

<p>When Madero is put out—in the almost automatic
fashion by which governments are overthrown in Latin
America—we refuse to recognize the man who, by armed
force, put him out, as he himself got in. Put a revolution
in the slot and out comes a President. We isolate
Huerta; we cut him off completely from the help of
other nations; we destroy his credit; we tell him he <em>must</em>
go, because we tolerate no man coming to power through
bloodshed. Huerta, it appears, was amusing but unquotable
about the recognition of Peru, saying in part
that both he and Benavides were military leaders, and
that both executed a <i lang="fr">coup d’état</i> resulting in the overthrow
of the existing government. In Peru the <i lang="es">révolution
du palais</i> cost the lives of eight functionaries, among them
the Ministers of War and Marine, the exile of President
Billinghurst, and ended in the setting up of a junta
government. As for the Peruvians themselves, they
are said to have had the vertigo, they were recognized
so suddenly—and so unexpectedly.</p>

<p>You will remember that months ago we gave asylum
for a week to Manuel Bonilla, and then conveyed him
to Vera Cruz, under dramatic circumstances, on his
promise not to join the rebels. Well, he joined the
rebels as quickly as time and space would allow, and we
read in this morning’s newspaper that he has now been
jailed by Carranza for plotting against <em>him</em>. I suppose he
got dissatisfied with what he was getting out of the rebels,
and tried something subversive that looked promising.
If Carranza gets any kind of proof against him—or probably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
without it—he will execute him some morning, in
the dawn. Oh, the thousands of men who have walked
out in the chilly, pale, Mexican dawn to render their
last accounts!</p>


<h3><em>March 17th.</em></h3>

<p>Yesterday I did not write. Aunt L. arrived unexpectedly,
at eight o’clock, and no one was at the station
to meet her. However, all’s well that ends well, and she
is now up in her red-carpeted, red-and-gold-papered, sun-flooded
room, and I hope will take a good rest. By way
of variety, not that I have much to choose from, I put
<cite>Marius the Epicurean</cite> and <cite>The Passionate Friends</cite> on her
night-table, with a single white rose. She has ridden her
own situation so courageously and so wittily all these
years, that I am thankful to have her here where she
can turn that charming blue eye of hers, which so makes
me think of yours, on <em>my</em> situation. When I looked into
her face this morning, I quite understood why they call
her the “Angel of the Isthmus.”</p>

<p>News from the north shows slow, but sure, disintegration
of the rebel ranks. It is the old story of the house
divided against itself. Also, Villa may be yielding to the
Capuan-like delights of Chihuahua and hesitating to
undertake a new, and perhaps inglorious, campaign
against Torreon. Just how Mr. Lind takes the slump
in rebels—for a slump there certainly has been—I
don’t know. We are beginning to see the results of
the long months of cabling his dreams to the President,
who, I am sure, if he ever awakes to the real
kind of bedfellows, that he has been dreaming
with, will nearly die. The Washington cerebration
doesn’t take in readily the kind of things that happen
here. All is known about burglars, white-slave trade,
wicked corporations, unfaithful stewards, defaulting
Sunday-school superintendents, baseball cheats, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
the like; but the murky, exotic passions that move Villa
are entirely outside consciousness.</p>

<p>Poor, old, frightened Carranza must feel more than
uneasy at the thought of that great, lowering brute in
the flush of triumph, who is waiting for him on the
raised dais in the government house at Chihuahua.
His “cause” is dead if he listens to Villa—and <em>he</em> is dead
if he doesn’t.</p>

<p>I had a call from the —— minister this morning,
and a talk about the matters none of us can keep away
from. He looks at politics without illusion and in a
rather Bismarckian way. He says we Americans are in
the act of destroying a people which is just becoming
conscious of itself and could, in a few generations, become
a nation; but that it never will do so, because we
are going to strangle its first cry. He considers that it
is a geographical and ethical necessity for us to have no
armed nation between us and Panama, and if we can
have the patience and the iron nerves to watch its dissolution
on the lines we are now pursuing, it will be ours
without a shot. But he adds that we will get nervous,
as all moderns do, watching a people on the rack, and
our policy will break. He added, with a smile, that nations
are like women, nervous and inconsistent; and
that, happily for the Mexicans and foreign Powers interested,
we won’t be able to stand the strain of watching
the horrors our policy would entail. I cried out against
this parting shot, but he went off with an unconvinced
gesture.</p>


<h3><em>March 19th.</em></h3>

<p>Yesterday we went to Chapultepec for the <i lang="es">fiançailles</i> of
the second son of Huerta and the daughter of General
Hernandez, now at the front. It was a large gathering,
at which many elements of the old society were present.
The powerful, wealthy, <i lang="fr">chic</i> Rincon Gaillardo clan are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
playing the part in the Huerta government that the
Escandons did in the Diaz régime—a work of amalgamation,
though they consistently boycotted the Madero
régime. Of course, there were many “curiosities.” The
two spinster sisters of Huerta were there with their flat,
strong Indian faces and thick, dark wigs <em>or</em> hair, naturally
steered one of them toward old gold for a costume,
and the other toward shot blue and red; but they were
dignified and smiling. Señora Blanquet is another curiosity.
Blanquet himself is one of the handsomest and
most <i lang="fr">distingué</i>-looking elderly men I have ever seen; but
his wife, was squat, and flat-faced, and very dark, seeming
to have come out of some long-hidden corner of his
history. Madame Huerta looked very handsome and
amiable in a good dress of white silk veiled with fine,
black lace, the famous big, round diamond hung by a
slender chain about her neck.</p>

<p>The prospective bridegroom, twenty-three, had his
mother’s eyes; and the family seemed happy in a nice,
simple way in the midst of their grandeur. The “tearless”
old man was in high spirits, and his speech at
the tea was a great success of spontaneity, with a few
fundamental truths and many flashes of humor. He
began by telling the young couple not to count on him,
or his position, but on their own efforts to create position
and honor; and to begin modestly.</p>

<p>“You know how I began,” he added, with what I can
only call a grin illuminating his whole face, “and look at
me now!”</p>

<p>Of course everybody applauded and laughed. Then
he became grave again. “Struggle,” he said, “is the essence
of life, and those who are not called on to struggle
are forgotten of Heaven. You all know what I am carrying.”
He told them, also, to honor and respect each
other, and to try to be models; adding, with another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
flash, “I have been a model, but a mediocre one!” (“<i lang="es">Yo
he sido un modelo—pero mediano!</i>”)</p>

<p>It all passed off very genially, with much drinking of
healths. Huerta has a way of moving his hands and
arms when he speaks, sometimes his whole body, without
giving any impression of animation; but those old
eyes look at any one he addresses in the concentrated
manner of the born leader. He had had a meeting of
many of the big <i lang="es">hacendados</i>, to beg their moral support
in the national crisis, and I imagine their attitude had
been very satisfactory. They are to contribute, among
other things, one hundred and sixty horses to haul the
new cannon and field-pieces shortly coming from France.
They are each to supply ten men, etc. He was wise
enough to ask them to do things they <em>could</em> do....</p>

<p>I saw a silver rebel peso the other day. It had <i lang="es">ejercito
constitucionalista</i> for part of its device, and the rest was
“<i lang="es">Muera Huerta!</i>” (“Death to Huerta!”) instead of some
more gentle thought, as “In God we trust.”</p>

<p>The stories of rebel excesses brought here, by refugees
from Durango, pass all description. It was the Constitucionalistas
under General Tomas Urbina who had the
first “go” at the town, and it was the priests, especially,
that suffered. The Jesuit and Carmelite churches were
looted, and when they got to the cathedral they had
the finest little game of <i lang="es">saqueo</i><a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> imaginable, breaking
open the tombs of long-dead bishops and prying the
dusty remains out with their bayonets, in the hunt for
valuables, after having rifled the sacristy of the holy
vessels and priceless old vestments. The wife of the
rebel <i lang="es">cabecilla</i> wore, in her carriage (or, rather, in somebody
else’s carriage), the velvet mantle taken from the
Virgen del Carmen, in the cathedral. The priests can’t
even get into the churches to say Mass, and their principal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
occupation seems to be ringing the bells on the saint’s
day of any little chieftain who happens to find himself
in Durango. The orgies that go on in the Government
house are a combination of drunkenness, revelings with
women of the town (who are decked out in the jewels and
clothes of the former society women of Durango), breaking
furniture and window-panes, and brawlings. The
once well-to-do people of the town go about in <i lang="es">peon</i>
clothes; anything else would be stripped from them.
This seems to be “constitutionalism” in its fullest
Mexican sense, and what crimes are committed in its
name! Heaps of handsome furniture, bronzes, pianos,
and paintings, once the appurtenances of the upper-class
homes, fill the plaza, or are thrown on dust-heaps outside
the town, too cumbersome to be handled by the
rebels and too far from the border to sell to the Texans,—to
whom, I understand, much of the loot of Chihuahua
goes for absurd prices.</p>

<p class="chapblock">Back to Vera Cruz—Luncheon on the <em>Chester</em>—San Juan’s prison horrors—Tea
on the <em>Mayflower</em>—The ministry of war and the commissary
methods—Torreon falls again?—Don Eduardo Iturbide.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Vera Cruz</span>, <em>March 21st</em>.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">N.’s sciatica is so bad that Dr. Fichtner told him to
get to sea-level immediately. So last night we
left, Dr. Ryan coming with us. At the station we
found a guard of fifty of the crack Twenty-ninth Regiment
to “protect” us, and a car placed at our disposal
by Huerta. We had already arranged to go with Hohler
and Mr. Easton, who is the secretary of the National
lines, in his private car, thinking we wouldn’t put the
government to the expense of one specially for us—though,
as the government already owes some millions
to the railroads, a few hundreds more or less would make
little difference. We were half an hour late, as we insisted
upon having the government car put off; but
the fifty soldiers, with a nice young captain, suffering
from an acute attack of tonsilitis, we could not shake.</p>

<p>At Vera Cruz we found a norther blowing, and I
was glad to have my tailor-made suits. Mr. Lind
seemed not quite so well as before. I think eight months
of Vera Cruz food and monotony have told on him, besides
the evident failure of his policy. He feels dreadfully
about the Creelman article. He cast one look of
supreme chagrin at me when I mentioned Shanklin’s disgust
at being quoted as having found Huerta in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
<i lang="fr">coulisses</i> of a theater, with an actress on each knee,
and with another hanging around his neck, feeding
him brandy. The truth being that Shanklin went to
pay his respects to him in his box at some charity representation,
and found Huerta, mightily bored, sitting
alone with two aides. The Lind thing is not so easy to
refute. He <em>did</em> write the letter to the rebel, Medina, and
he has dreamed dreams, and sent them on to Washington.
His policy is a dead failure, and I think its ghost
walks with him at night.</p>

<p>We lunched on the <em>Chester</em> with Captain Moffett, who
is most discriminating about the whole situation, and,
after an hour on the wind-swept deck, came back to the
car, where we found delightful, spontaneous Captain
McDougall, of the <em>Mayflower</em>, come to ask us if we
wouldn’t transfer our bags and ourselves and servant
over to his ship. The annoying part of the whole trip
is that Admiral Fletcher is in Mexico City. We did not
tell any one of our coming down to Vera Cruz, nor did
he announce that he was coming up, with Mrs. Fletcher
and his two daughters. However, it is simply one of
those annoying <i lang="fr">contretemps</i> for which there is no help.
They went up by the “Interoceanic” route as we came
down by the “Mexican.” I would have returned myself,
leaving N. on the <em>Mayflower</em>; but he feels that he must
carry out the plan of returning to-morrow night, as he
has correspondence that he wants to show the admiral.</p>


<h3><em>Sunday.</em></h3>

<p>Last night we dined on the <em>Essex</em>, to which Admiral
Cradock has transferred his flag, the <em>Suffolk</em> having gone
to Bermuda for a new coat of paint and other furbishings.
Admiral Cradock is always the same delightful
friend and companion. I played bridge till a late
hour, with the admiral, Hohler, and Captain Watson.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
Watson has just come from Berlin, where for three
years he was naval <i lang="fr">attaché</i>. I saw many photographs of
old friends—the Granvilles, Sir Edward Goschen, the
Grews, the Kaiser. After a rather uncertain trip back to
the shore, Hohler, Nelson, and myself threaded our way
along the dark interstices of the Vera Cruz wharves and
terminal tracks to the car—I, in long dress and thin
slippers, bowed to the <i lang="es">norte</i>.</p>

<p>We can’t get out to the <em>Florida</em>, Captain Rush in
command, on account of the high sea. I went to Mass
with Ryan in the cathedral, which they have painted a
hideous, cold gray, with white trimmings, since I saw it
last. Then it had its <i lang="fr">belle patiné</i> of pinkish-brown, that
shone like bronze in the setting sun, and it was beautiful
at all hours. However, the winds and the storms and
the hot sun will again beautify man’s hideous work.</p>


<h3><em>In the Car. Sunday Evening.</em></h3>

<p>We had lunch for Admiral Cradock and several of his
staff in the car, to which we had also asked Captain
Moffett and Captain McDougall—a rather “close,” but
merry company of nine officers and myself, in the little
dining-room. After dinner we started out to San Juan
Ulua.</p>


<h3><em>Monday, 10.30</em> <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span></h3>

<p>I am comfortably writing in my state-room. We are
not yet near Mexico City. My beloved volcanoes are a
little unradiant, a dusty veil hangs over everything. It
is often that way a month before the rains begin.</p>

<p>When we got to the station at seven, last night, we
found that the train, which, according to schedule, was
to leave at 7.20, had departed, with our private car and
the servants, at 6.55. The servants had begged at
least to have our car uncoupled, but no! You can imagine
the faces of the <i lang="fr">chargés</i> who <em>had</em> to be in Mexico<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
City Monday morning. The upshot of it all was that a
locomotive was finally got ready, sent to catch the train
and to bring back our car. After the telegraph and
telephone, the whole station, and the town, for that
matter, were up on end, we got off at ten o’clock. If the
car had not come back, we intended to board a locomotive
and to chase the train through the tropical
night. The locomotive we finally secured broke down
later on. On one of the steep, dark, flower-scented
inclines, strange, dusky silhouettes gathered silently to
watch the repairing, which was finally accomplished in
the uncertain light of torch and lantern. Now we are
due at the city at 12.30, the locomotive, our car, the car
containing the fifty soldiers, and the poor officer who
hasn’t had even a drop of water since he left Mexico City,
Friday night. We sent pillows and blankets out to him
and tried to make him comfortable, but of the good cheer,
wine and viands he could take none.</p>

<p>I must tell you about the visit to the prison of San
Juan. After lunch, Dr. Ryan, Captain McDougall, Dr.
Hart, Mr. Easton, and I got into the <em>Mayflower’s</em> boat
and were taken to the landing of that most miserable of
places. A strong wind was blowing from the purifying
sea, which must help, from October to April, at least, to
keep San Juan from being an unmitigated pest-hole. It
is a huge place, composed of buildings of different periods,
from the Conquerors to Diaz, with intersecting
canals between great masses of masonry. To get to the
commandant’s quarters we were obliged to skirt the
water’s edge, where narrow slits of about three inches’
width, in walls a meter and a half thick, lead into otherwise
unlighted and unaired dungeons. Human sounds
came faintly from these apertures.</p>

<p>Entering through the portcullis, we found ourselves in
the big courtyard where the official life of the prison<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
goes on, overlooked by the apartments of the colonel
and the closely guarded cells for big political prisoners.
Good-conduct men, with bits of braid on one arm, solicited
us to buy the finely carved fruit-stones and cocoa-nuts.
To us these represented monkeys, heads, and the
like; to the men that make them they represent sanity
and occupation for the horrible hours—though God alone
knows how they work the fine and intricate patterns in
the semi-darkness of even the “best” dungeons.</p>

<p>Afterward we went up on the great parapets, the
<i lang="es">norte</i> blowing fiercely—I in my black Jeanne Hallé
hobble-skirt and a black tulle hat, as later we were to
go to tea on the <em>Mayflower</em>. We walked over great, flat
roofs of masonry in which were occasional square, barred
holes. Peering down in the darkness, thirty feet or so,
of any one of these, there would be, at first, no sound,
only a horrible, indescribable stench mingling with the
salt air. But as we threw boxes of cigarettes into the
foul blackness there came vague, human groans and
rumbling noises, and we could see, in the blackness, human
hands upstretched or the gleam of an eye. If above,
in that strong norther, we could scarcely stand the
stench that arose, what must it have been in the
depths below? About eight hundred men live in those
holes.</p>

<p>When we got back to the central court, our hearts
sick with the knowledge of misery we could do nothing to
alleviate, the prison afternoon meal was being served—coffee,
watery bean soup, and a piece of bread. Oh, the
pale, malaria-stricken Juans and Ramons and Josés that
answered to the roll-call, carrying their tin cups and
dishes, as they passed the great caldrons. They filed
out, blinking and stumbling, before the armed sentinels,
to return in a moment to the filthy darkness! Captain
McDougall, a very human sort of person, tasted of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
coffee from one of their tin cups. He said it wasn’t
bad, and he gave the men a friendly word and packages
of cigarettes as they passed.</p>

<p>We bought all the little objects they had to sell,
and distributed among them dozens of boxes of cigarettes.
But we, with liberty, honors, opulence, and hopes,
felt the foolishness of our presence, our blessing of liberty
being all that any one of them would ask. The prisoners
are there for every crime imaginable, but many of
the faces were sorrowful and fever-stamped, rather than
brutal. <em>All</em> were apparently forgotten of Heaven and
unconsidered of man. We also visited the little, wind-swept
cemetery, with its few graves. The eternal hot
tides wash in and out of the short, sandy stretch that
bounds it. About the only “healing” worked here is
what the salt sea does to the poor bodies raked out of
those prison holes. There is a stone to mark the place
where some of our men were buried when they took the
fortress in 1847. Dr. Ryan discovered a foot in a good
American boot—evidently the remains of an individual
recently eaten by a shark.</p>

<p>That fortress has been the home of generations of
horrors, and there is no one in God’s world to break
through that oozing masonry and alleviate the suffering
it conceals. It was one of the cries of Madero to open
up the prison, but he came, and passed, and San Juan
Ulua persists. I haven’t described one-tenth of the
horrors. I know there <em>must</em> be prisons and there <em>must</em> be
abuses in all communities; but this pest-hole at the entrance
to the great harbor where our ships lie within a
stone’s-throw seems incredible.</p>

<p>Afterward, the contrast of tea, music, and smart,
ready-to-dance young officers on the beautiful <em>Mayflower</em>
rather inclined me to stillness. I was finding it difficult
to let God take care of <em>His</em> world!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span></p>


<h3><em>March 24th.</em></h3>

<p>I am sitting in the motor, jotting this down in the
shade of some trees by the beautiful Alameda, waiting
for N. to finish at the Foreign Office. Afterward he goes
to “<i lang="es">Guerra</i>” and I to shop.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon, on our return from Vera Cruz,
N. dashed to the telephone and communicated with the
Fletchers. They came to tea at four. Later Nelson
went out with the admiral, and I drove to San Angel
with Mrs. Fletcher and her two pretty daughters. She
is most agreeable. Her appreciation of the sunset on the
volcanoes, which were in their most splendid array for
the occasion, was all my heart could have asked. They
return to Vera Cruz to-night.</p>

<p>I am feeling very fit, after a good night’s rest; the air
envelops me like a luminous wrap, and the sun is softly
penetrating.</p>

<p>The arms and ammunition are not yet delivered.
Nothing was done in N.’s absence, of course. He didn’t
want them, anyway; of what use are they in civilian
hands?...</p>

<p>The War Ministry is just off the <i lang="es">Zocalo</i>, in one side of
the great, square building of the Palacio Nacional.
From where I am sitting I see the soft, pink towers of
the cathedral, in their lacy outlines. On the left is the
Museo Nacional—a beautiful old building of the pink,
<i lang="es">tezontle</i> stone the Spaniards used to such effect in their
buildings. It contains all the Aztec treasures still remaining
after centuries of destruction, and has a cozy,
sun-warmed <i lang="es">patio</i> where the sacrificial altars and the
larger pieces are grouped. Most of them were found in
the very site of the cathedral, which replaced the <i lang="es">teocalli</i>
of the Aztecs—the first thing the Spaniards destroyed,
to rear on its site the beautiful cathedral. I am surrounded
by an increasing crowd of beggars, drawn by a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
few indiscreet centavos given to an old Indian woman,
who too loudly blessed me; cries of “<i lang="es">Niña, por el amor
de Dios!</i>” and “<i lang="es">Niña, por la Santa Madre de Dios!</i>” make
me feel that I would better move on. The name of God
is invoked so unceasingly by the beggars here that the
word <i lang="es">pordiosero</i> (for-Godsaker, beggar,) has passed into
the language.</p>


<h3><em>At Home, before Lunch.</em></h3>

<p>N. came out of <i lang="es">Guerra</i>, having met in the corridor the
immensely tall Colonel Cardenas, the best shot in Mexico.
He is supposed to know just how Madero’s mortal
coil was hustled off. He was in command of the
squad transporting him and Pino Suarez from the Palacio
to the <i lang="es">Penitenciaría</i> when they were shot. We then went
to the third side of the Palacio Nacional, where the zapadores
barracks is, to see how the officer of the Twenty-ninth,
who went down with us to Vera Cruz, is getting
on. It was very interesting, at twelve o’clock, to watch
the various persons who bring food into the barracks.
The guards search them all—men, women, and children—by
passing their hands down their sides. The prettier
young women get pinches or pokes anywhere the guard
happens to fancy bestowing them, and they all give little
squeals and jumps, sometimes annoyed, sometimes
pleased. They bring in great baskets of <i lang="es">tortillas</i>, <i lang="es">enchiladas</i>,
<i lang="es">frijoles</i>, fruits, etc. The men in the barracks are
absolutely dependent on them for food, as there is no
other army supply. Another guard kept off troublesome,
too solicitous small boys with a bit of twisted twine,
flicking them, with a stinging sound, about the legs. I
found it most amusing. Finally the young captain himself
came out to thank us and to tell us he was almost
well—with an expectant look on his pale face. He
wants N. to have him made a major. Why not,
when every officer seems to have been promoted—a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
clever trick of Huerta’s. He has made several extra
grades at the top to give himself room. He will need
space for manœuvers of an army largely composed of
higher officers. He is going to get the interior loan of
fifty millions, with the guarantee of the Paris loan....
The Austro-Hungarian minister has just come to ask
me to go out to San Angel with him, so adieu.</p>


<h3><em>March 25th.</em></h3>

<p>We have just had a beautiful motor-drive out to San
Angel Inn, talking politics and scenery. The volcanoes
had great lengths of clouds, thrown like twisted scarfs,
about their dazzling heads.</p>

<p>Kanya de Kanya was with Count Aerenthal during his
four years in Vienna, as Minister for Foreign Affairs, and
during that time made copious notes relating to the
burning questions of the Near East, which will, of course,
throw light on the big international issues of that period.
He is hoping for a quiet time out here, to get them in
order, though he can’t publish them until a lot more
water has flowed under the Austro-Hungarian mill.</p>

<p>I got home in time to sit with Aunt Laura awhile before
dressing for dinner, for which I was expecting
Hohler. The meal was somewhat unquiet. One of the
newspaper men called up to say that Torreon had fallen,
and gave a few convincing details, such as that of Velasco’s
life being spared. The fifty-million-dollar loan
receded into the dim distance. We immediately pictured
to ourselves the pillaging, ravishing hordes of
Villa—the “human tiger,” as some of our newspapers
mildly put it—falling down upon Mexico City, the
peaceful. Nelson ordered the motor, and he and Hohler
went out, as soon as dinner was over, to get some news
at the War Department. A big fight, we know, is going
on. As I write, brother is killing and mutilating brother,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
in the fertile <i lang="es">laguna</i> district, and horrors unspeakable are
taking place. Velasco is said to be honest and capable,
and he has money and ammunition.</p>

<p>General Maure, who left for the front a few days ago,
wouldn’t start until he had money enough for two
months for his men. He also is supposed to be honest,
and if he <em>does</em> feed his men, instead of putting the money
in some bank in the States (if they would <em>all</em> feed their
men, instead of asking worn, empty-stomached men to
do the work), he may, perhaps, proceed toward victory.
The corruption of the officers is what nullifies the work
of the army, and Huerta says he is powerless against it.
Any man he might court-martial is sure of the support
of the United States. In order to remain faithful the
troops only ask enough food to keep life in their bodies
during the campaign. The picture of starving troops,
locked in box-cars during the night, to prevent their deserting,
and then being called on to fight when they are
let out in the morning, makes one fairly sick. A free
hand at loot and a full stomach on food belonging to
somebody else are naturally irresistible when the chance
comes.</p>

<p>Such an appreciative letter has come from Archbishop
Riordan, thanking Nelson for his Pius Fund achievement.</p>

<p>Mexico has declined, upon good international law, to
take upon herself the board bill (now amounting to hundreds
of thousands in gold) for the interned refugees
at Fort Bliss. We wonder how long Uncle Sam will feel
like playing host? This situation, among many tragic
ones growing out of our policy, is the only thing that
calls an unrestrained grin to the face—a grin at Uncle
Sam’s expense.</p>


<h3><em>March 27th. Morning.</em></h3>

<p>I am sitting in the motor in Chapultepec Park, under
the shade of a great cypress, while N. converses with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
Dictator in his motor down the avenue. All sorts of
birds are singing, and a wonderful little humming-bird
(<i lang="es">chupamirtos</i>, the Indians call them) is so near I can hear
it “hum.” Elim is running over the green grass with his
butterfly-net. I am thinking, “Sweet day, so soft, so
cool, so bright.” This seems the city of peace. In the
north the great combat continues. The rebels use almost
exclusively expansive bullets, which give no chance
to the wounded. Huerta, whom Nelson saw last night,
is calm and imperturbable. His loan of 50,000,000 pesos
is an accomplished fact. This won’t suit Washington.</p>

<p>Nelson was speaking this morning of the famous interview
between Lind, Gamboa (then Minister for Foreign
Affairs), and himself—that interview which has now become
part of history. Lind has a characteristic gesture—that
of tapping with his right hand on his left
wrist. With this gesture to emphasize his words
he said to Gamboa, “Three things we can do if Huerta
does not resign: First, use the financial boycott.” (This
has been done.) “Second, recognize the rebels.” (This
has been done to the fullest extent by raising the embargo,
giving them full moral support and being ready
to give them financial aid with the slightest co-operation
and decency on their part). “Third, intervene.”</p>

<p>These propositions were set forth nearly eight months
ago, and to-day Huerta’s position is better, by far, than
at that time. He has kept law and order in his provinces.
The big third thing—intervention—yet remains, but on
what decent grounds can we intervene?</p>

<p>If, by any remote chance, the rebels should get here,
what desecrations, what violations of Mexico City—the
peaceful, the beautiful!</p>


<h3><em>At Home. Afternoon.</em></h3>

<p>I waited a long time for Nelson this morning. Gen.
Rincon Gaillardo came up to speak to me, looking very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
smart in his khaki riding-clothes with a touch of gold
braid. He is an erect, light-haired, straight-featured
Anglo-Saxon-looking man. He had just returned from a
tour of inspection in Hidalgo; had ridden through the
state with a couple of aides, and had found everything
most peaceful. I asked, of course, if there was any news
from the north; but everywhere wire and communication
of any kind is cut, and no one knows. Eduardo
Iturbide (he is spoken of as governor of the Federal district
to succeed Corona), also came up to speak to me.
A lot of people were waiting to see Huerta, but he
never hurries. After he had seen Rincon Gaillardo and
Nelson, he went away, ignoring discomfited occupants of
half a dozen motors.</p>

<p>Iturbide always says he has no political talents, but
it was inevitable that he be drawn into events here. He
would give prestige and dignity to any office. There is
a description of the Emperor Augustin Iturbide, “brave,
active, handsome, in the prime of life,” that entirely applies
to him. I wonder, sometimes, if Don Eduardo’s
fate may not be as tragic as that of the man whose name
he bears. The ingredients of tragedy are never missing
from any Mexican political situation. The only variation
lies in the way they are mixed. What I call Mexican
magic has a way of arresting judgment. One never
thinks a thing will happen here until it has happened—not
though a thousand analogous situations have worked
themselves out to their inevitable, tragic end. It was
Don Eduardo who made to me the profound and tragedy-pointing
remark, “We understand you better than you
understand us.”<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span></p>
<p>Huerta keeps very calm, these days, Nelson says; no
nerves <em>there</em> while waiting for news. I suppose he knows
just how bad his men are, and also the very indefinite
quality of the rebels. He talked of two years’ work being
necessary for pacification, and then of going to live
in Washington, to prove that he is neither a wild Indian
nor a brigand. He is very pleased to get his loan; the
money is here, and he has known how to get hold of it.</p>

<p>At the outset Huerta was surrounded by experienced
and responsible men, but when it became generally understood
that the United States would not recognize his
government, intrigues were started against him, and he
was forced to make changes in his Cabinet. Later on,
when a friend reproached him with this, he answered,
quite frankly, “No one regrets it more than I; for now,
unfortunately, all my friends are thieves!”</p>

<p>Yesterday’s copy of <cite>Mister Lind</cite> has, as a frontispiece,
Mr. Wilson and Villa, standing in a red pool,
drinking each other’s health from cups dripping with
blood. It is awful to think such things can exist, even
in imagination. N. has protested to the Federal
authorities.</p>


<h3><em>March 28th.</em></h3>

<p>This morning the newspapers give the “sad” news
that Carranza seems to be lost in the desert—the mountain
lost on its way to Mohammed! General Aquevedo,
who knows that country as he knows his pocket, is supposed
to be after him with 1,200 men. I don’t think
Villa would weep other than crocodile tears if anything
happened to Carranza; but what would Washington do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
without that noble old man to bear the banner of Constitutionalism?
“One year of Bryan makes the whole
world grin!” The idealization of a pettifogging old lawyer
(<i lang="es">licenciado</i>), who had already laid his plans to turn
against Madero, and the sanctification of a bloodthirsty
bandit, might well make the whole world grin, if the
agony of a people were not involved.</p>

<p>I went with Dr. Ryan, this morning, to visit the General
Hospital. It is a magnificent establishment, modeled
on the General Hospital in Paris, with complete
electrical, hydro-therapeutic, and mechanical appliances,
thirty-two large sun- and air-flooded pavilions, operating-rooms,
and special buildings for tuberculosis patients,
children, and contagious diseases. The sad part of it is
that it is only about a third full. The <i lang="es">leva</i> (press-gang)
always rakes in a lot of men here. They hang about the
handsome doors and grab the dismissed patients, which
makes the poor wretches prefer to suffer and die in their
nameless holes.</p>

<p>On returning, I went down to the Palacio Nacional
with N., who was on a still hunt for the President. The
arms are not yet in the Embassy. As I was sitting in the
motor with Elim, the French <i lang="la">chargé</i> got out of his motor
with Captain de Bertier, the French military <i lang="la">attaché</i>
just arrived from Washington, and looking very smart
in his spick-and-span uniform, ready for his official
presentation to Huerta. They had their appointment
for twelve, which had already struck, but the President
was not there, having departed to Popotla. Huerta
works along his own lines, and a missed appointment is
little to him.</p>

<p>Just home. Mr. de Soto has called me up to tell me
there is bad news from the front; but I think even the
bad news is a rumor, as every line around Torreon has
been cut for days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span></p>


<h3><em>March 28th. 11.30</em> <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span></h3>

<p>At last news is in from the north (by the Associated
Press), from Gomez Palacio and Ciudad Juarez. Two
train-loads of rebel wounded had arrived, and Villa had
hastily telegraphed for more hospital supplies, though
he had taken with him an enormous quantity. At the
end of five days’ continuous fighting the rebels had
failed to make any break in the almost impregnable defenses
of Torreon and Gomez Palacio. Wounded troopers
say that by order of Villa they charged into almost
certain death at Gomez Palacio, bringing upon themselves
the heavy cannonading from the Federal guns;
that they were deliberately sacrificed in order that other
forces might be able to attack the town at other points
without encountering much resistance. And there are
strange rumors of Villa’s succumbing to temptation from
the “movie” men, and holding the attack back till daybreak!
It is terrible to contemplate the slaughter of
unquestioning and innocent Pepes and Juans. I burn
to go with the hospital service. There will be terrible
need on both sides, and a wounded man is neither rebel
nor Federal.</p>

<p>This is largely an agrarian revolution, and Huerta was
the first to realize it. He says that everybody has
made promises to the people, and nobody has kept them.
I wonder, if the people ever get a chance to make promises,
will <em>they</em> keep them? <i lang="es">Quién sabe?</i> However, all this
is not a question of taking sides, but of stating facts.</p>

<p>The invitation of the United States to Huerta to
attend the Hague Conference has been solemnly accepted
by him; now international jurists are called on
to decide if the very sending of the invitation does not
imply technical recognition. It is one of those slips
which occasionally happen, and Huerta is too astute to
let that, or any other opportunity, pass where he can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
score against the United States. Things being equal, he
could <i lang="fr">rouler</i> Washington as it has never been <i lang="fr">rouléd</i> before;
but things aren’t equal, and he can only show
immense courage, sustained indifference, and indomitable
will in whatever may come up. Just now more and
more troops are being rushed to the north.</p>

<p>We are delighted to hear that Warren Robbins and
Jack White are to be sent here as second and third secretaries.
There is ample work for all, and it will be
pleasant to have friends and co-workers. It has been a
wearing time for N., single-handed in all official decisions
and representations.</p>

<p>News from the north is more encouraging, but a horrible
struggle is going on. Elim and I went with Nelson
to Chapultepec. Though the park is no longer crowded
in the morning, as in the old days, the band having disappeared,
with a lot of other things, there is still much
strolling about the cypress-shaded alleys. A shining
freshness filters through the old trees, the birds sing, the
children play. Its beauty makes one’s heart both glad
and sick. As we expected, we found the President
sitting in his motor, which was surrounded by half
a dozen others full of petitioners of all sorts. General
Corral, in his khaki, came up to salute me and to
say good-by. He had just taken leave of the President
and was on his way to the station, whence he was starting
to the north with 2,000 men. I pressed his hand
and wished him Godspeed; but he may never again
stand under those trees with a smile on his face and hope
in his heart.</p>

<p>The President got out of his auto and I out of ours,
and we had a talk, I presenting Elim. Huerta really is
a <em>charming</em> old fellow! I told him I was anxious to go
to Saltillo with the <i lang="es">Cruz Roja</i>. He said, “There will be
work to do here in town, and I will make you head of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
the International League. You are very kind!” (“<i lang="es">Vd. es
muy buena, Señora.</i>”) And he pressed my hand with
those small, velvety paws of his. He has discarded the
slouch-hat and now wears with his long, loose frock-coat
a top-hat—(“<i lang="es">que da mas dignidad</i>”) “for the sake of
dignity,” he said, when Nelson told him he was “very
stunning.”</p>

<p>Afterward we went down to the Buena Vista station,
where General Corral’s troops were being entrained.
We found a very busy scene. There were long lines of
baggage-cars, with fresh straw covering the floors; other
baggage-cars containing army women, with their small
children, babes at the breast, and the bigger children,
who may be of service. Infants between two and ten are
left behind. There is a good deal of heterogeneous impedimenta.
Having no homes, these women are wont
to take all their possessions with them—bird-cages,
goats, old oil-cans, filled with Heaven knows what. The
soldiers were laughing and joking, and the venders of
fruits, highly colored bonbons, and still more highly colored
sweet drinks, were having a busy time. The sun
was terribly hot, so we came away, I with a prayer in my
heart for the poor devils. <em>Is</em> “God in His heaven”? <em>Is</em>
“all well with the world”?</p>


<h3><em>Monday Morning.</em></h3>

<p>I am advising Dr. Ryan to get off to Torreon. I
myself telegraphed to Admiral Fletcher, asking that a
box of hospital stores, bandages, cotton, iodine, adhesive
tape, and bichloride tablets be sent up by the officer
who is coming up to stay with us. Dr. Ryan can
get off to-morrow afternoon. There is work, much
work, to do, and I am sick that “my position” prevents
me from going with him. My hands are trembling
for work.</p>

<p>As to news, everybody in town is pleased, Huertistas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
and Villistas alike. The former have had word of complete
victory—and the latter hears that the rebel forces
had taken every gate in Torreon and that the Federals
were in full retreat!</p>

<p class="chapblock">Congress meets without the United States representative—Huerta
makes his “profession of faith”—Exit Mr. Lind—Ryan leaves for
the front—French and German military <i lang="fr">attachés</i>—The Jockey Club.</p>


<h3><em>April 1st. Morning.</em></h3>

<p class="dropcap">Yesterday Lieutenant Courts (one of Admiral
Fletcher’s flag lieutenants) arrived for an indefinite
time. He is a shrewd and capable young officer, ready
to study the situation intelligently and dispassionately.
The big house is again full.</p>

<p>Yesterday we lunched at the German Legation. The
luncheon was given for the French military <i lang="fr">attaché</i>,
Count de Bertier de Sauvigny, and the German, Herr von
Papen, both from Washington for a few weeks. The
Simons were there, the von Hillers, and various others,
everybody trying to enlighten the two new arrivals as to
<i lang="es">la situación</i>. Both find themselves in a position requiring
some tact and agility to keep their seats—<i lang="fr">à cheval</i>
as they are between Washington and Mexico City.
Von Hintze has never cared for Huerta. Occasionally,
very occasionally, he has given him grudging praise; but
a man of von Hintze’s fastidiousness would always find
himself <i lang="fr">fluide contraire</i> to a man of just Huerta’s defects—defects
which, I have sometimes argued with von
Hintze, become qualities in Mexico. All came to tea
with me later. De Bertier is a very handsome man, of
the tall, distinguished, fine-featured Gallic type; von<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
Papen, with a pleasant and inquiring smile, is the quintessence
of the Teuton, his square head and every face
bone in relief against the Mexican amalgam type my
eyes are accustomed to.</p>

<p>The story about the loan, Simon says, is true. Huerta
remarked to the banking magnates that he had, outside
the door, two soldiers apiece for each gentleman; that
there were plenty of trees in Chapultepec; that he would
give them ten minutes to decide what they would do.
He got the loan.</p>

<p>In the evening Hay and Courts and H. Walker and
Ryan dined with us, all staying late. Dr. Ryan fears he
can’t get up to Torreon. The road between Monterey
and Saltillo was blown up the night before last, and it is
useless to try to get through that desert afoot or on
horseback.</p>


<h3><em>Later.</em></h3>

<p>I went out to Chapultepec with N. and Courts. I
wanted to show Courts the administrative tableau set in
the morning beauty of the park, and N. had urgent
business with the President. There was the usual array
of autos there, the President in his own, talking with
de la Lama, Minister of Finance. Afterward Hohler,
Manuel del Campo, and the two García Pimentel men,
black-clad, came up, having been to the <i lang="es">honras</i> of Ignacio
Algara, brother of the Mexican <i lang="fr">chargé</i> in Washington.
They were going to have a sandwich, and
asked Courts and me to go into the restaurant, which
we did. N. appeared a few minutes later, the President
with him. The much-advertised <i lang="es">copitas</i> were immediately
served, the President scarcely touching his glass.
After much badinage between Huerta and N. the <i lang="fr">jeunesse
dorée</i> looking on rather embarrassed, Huerta departed,
with an obeisance to me, and a large, circular gesture
to the others. He had a telegram from Ciudad Porfirio<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
Diaz, telling of immense losses of the rebels and
of the Federals still holding their ground—which may
or may not be true. The little story I paste here is indicative
of Mexicans in general, and of the situation in
particular:</p>

<p>The safest bet regarding the many stories about Torreon yesterday,
was the answer of a Mexican mozo to his master’s query as to
whether it would rain. After a careful survey of the heavens Juan
replied: “Puede que si, o puede que no, pero lo mas probable es,
quién sabe?” (Perhaps it will—perhaps it won’t; but the most
probable is “<em>who knows</em>?”)</p>


<h3><em>April 2d.</em></h3>

<p>Congress reopened yesterday. Huerta showed some
emotion when, in the morning, Nelson informed him
that he could not be present. In the same room that
saw its dissolution, the same old Indian, in a business-like
speech that would do credit to any ruler, briefly outlined
to Congress the work of government, pending detailed
reports by the departments. There is a tragic
note in the fact that this persecuted government, in the
midst of all its anxieties, can discuss such matters as
the subterranean hydrology of the plateau, and the sending
of delegates to the electro-technic congress, in Berlin.
Huerta wound up his speech with these solemn and
stirring words:</p>

<p>“Before I leave this hall I must engrave upon your
hearts this, my purpose, which on another occasion I
communicated to the National Assembly in the most
explicit manner—the peace of the republic. If, in order
to secure it, the sacrifice of you and of me becomes indispensable,
know, once for all, that you and I shall know
how to sacrifice ourselves. This is my purpose, my profession
of political faith.”</p>

<p>There was immense applause. But his task seems
superhuman. To fight the rebels <em>and</em> the United States
is not simply difficult—it is impossible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span></p>


<h3><em>April 2d. Evening.</em></h3>

<p>Villa talks freely about his plan when he triumphs:
first and foremost, it is to execute Huerta and his whole
political family, on the principle that the first duty of a
“Mexican executive is to execute”; then to set up a
dictatorship for a year. The program drips with blood;
and these are the people we are bolstering up!</p>

<p>Lind leaves to-night for Washington, so exit from the
tragic scene Don Juan Lindo (I sometimes feel like calling
him Don Juan Blindo), who commenced life in a
Scandinavian town as Jon Lind, and who has ended by
dreaming northern dreams in Vera Cruz, in the hour of
Mexico’s agony. My heart is unspeakably bewildered
at this trick of fate; and, too, he would have long since
precipitated <em>us</em> into war had it not been for the shrewd
common sense and trained knowledge of the gifted man
at the head of the fleet in Vera Cruz....</p>

<p>A hot indignation invades me as Mr. Lind drops
out of the most disastrous chapter of Mexican history
and returns to Minnesota. (Oh, what a far cry!) Upon
his hands the blood of those killed with the weapons
of the raising of the embargo—those weapons that, in
some day and hour unknown to us, must inevitably be
turned against their donors. It is all as certain as
death, though there are many who refuse to look even
<em>that</em> fact in the face.</p>

<p>I am not keen about the confidential agent system,
anyway. With more standing in the community than
spies, and much less information, they are in an unrivaled
position to mislead (wittingly or unwittingly is a detail)
any one who depends on them for information. Apropos
of Mr. Lind, one of the foreigners here said it was as if
Washington kept a Frenchman in San Francisco to inform
them concerning our Japanese relations. For some
strange reason, any information delivered by confidential<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
agents, is generally swallowed, hook and all, but
unfortunately, the mere designating of them does not
bestow upon them any sacramental grace.</p>


<h3><em>April 5th.</em></h3>

<p><i lang="es">Domingo de Ramos</i> (Palm Sunday), with soft wind and
warm sun. The palms were blessed at the nine-o’clock
Mass in the cathedral. The great pillars of the church
were hung with purple; thousands of palms were waving
from devout hands, the hands of beggars and the rich
alike, and there was some good Gregorian music, instead
of the generally rather florid compositions. Near
where I knelt was a paralyzed Indian girl, crawling along
on the most beautiful hands I have ever seen. Her Calvary
is constant.</p>

<p>Wonderful palm plaitings, of all shapes and patterns,
are offered by the Indians as one enters the church. I
bought a beautiful sort of Greek-cross design, with silvery
grasses depending from it. It now hangs over my
bed.</p>

<p>We hear that the Bishop of Chilapa is held by Zapata
for a big ransom. As all the well-to-do families have
either fled from that part of the country or been robbed
of all they had, the ransom may not be paid. There is
a threat to crucify him on Good Friday, if it is not forthcoming,
but I hardly think he is in danger, as such an act
would certainly be thought to bring a curse upon the
people and the place. This is the second time he has
been made prisoner. He was rescued by Federal soldiers
only a few weeks ago.</p>


<h3><em>Monday Evening.</em></h3>

<p>We had a pleasant luncheon at Chapultepec restaurant,
on the veranda—von Hintze, Kanya de Kanya, Stalewski,
the Bonillas, Courts, Strawbensie (the young naval
officer up from the <em>Essex</em>, who is supposed to be training
the British colony volunteers), Lady C., von Papen, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
ourselves; de Bertier, the French military <i lang="fr">attaché</i>, did
not materialize. They think, apropos of Torreon (“the
key of the <em>south</em>,” for the rebels; “the key of the <em>north</em>,”
for the Federals), that the Federals may have been obliged
to evacuate it and are now fighting to get it back.
Any one seems able to take Torreon, and no one seems
able to hold it.</p>


<h3><em>Tuesday Evening.</em></h3>

<p>At two o’clock Dr. Ryan left for the front, von Papen
with him. Ryan has learned to travel light, but von
Papen took a lot of impedimenta—eating-utensils, uniform,
blanket, pungaree hat, etc. He will drop his possessions,
one by one, as—after Saltillo, which they
should reach to-morrow night—they may be on horseback,
or afoot. I was deeply touched to see Dr. Ryan go
off. I made the sign of the cross on his shoulder<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and
commended him to Heaven as we stood at the gate
under the brilliant sky. He is so pleased to be taking
all those stores with him—enough for two hundred and
fifty or three hundred dressings, not including the other
materials.</p>

<p>I received calls all afternoon. At four the two handsome
Garcia Pimentel sisters came—Lola Riba and
Rafaela Bernal. At five the Japanese minister brought
his wife for her first formal call. They are cultivated
people, with the quality that makes one feel they
are used to the best at home. I <em>made</em> conversation till
six, when Clarence Hay saved my life. At seven, just as
I had gone up-stairs, a Frenchman—a banker—appeared.
At eight I was too tired for dinner, which N.
and I ignored. The “doves of peace” are beginning to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
settle in the Embassy dove-cote to-night—about a <em>ton</em>
of them already here.</p>


<h3><em>Wednesday Morning. April 8th.</em></h3>

<p>A Federal officer, Colonel Arce, got in from Torreon
last night. He says that on Friday, the third, it was still
in the hands of the Federals. Chieftain Urbina, a notorious
rebel, had been captured and forced, with other
Revolutionists, to parade the streets of Torreon, between
a detachment of Federal troops. Then he was
summarily executed in the presence of an immense
crowd. The railway lines are open between San Pedro
and Saltillo, and on to Mexico City. Unless they are
again blown up, Dr. Ryan and von Papen will be able
to get to San Pedro, where Generals de Maure, Hidalgo,
Corral (the one I saw off), are stationed, with large reinforcements.
We’ll take the report for what it is
worth. One thing we know: the carnage is going on.</p>

<p>The story just now is that General Velasco, the very
competent Federal in command of Torreon, voluntarily
evacuated, took his army and his field-guns to the hills
above Torreon, with non-combatants and women and
children, cut the water-supply, and is now waiting orders
from Huerta to bombard the town. He, of course, has
plenty of water where he is; but Torreon dry must be a
thing of horror. This story agrees with a good deal we
have been hearing. If true, it will really be a great <i lang="fr">coup</i>
on the part of the Federals.</p>


<h3><em>April 9th. Holy Thursday.</em></h3>

<p>The churches are full to overflowing, these holy days.
Men, women, and children, of all strata of society, are
faithful in the discharge of their duties. In this city of
peace, how contrasting the tales of sacrilege in the rebel
territory! Five priests were killed and three held for
ransom in Tamaulipas, last month; a convent was
sacked and burned and the nuns were outraged; a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
cathedral was looted, the rebels getting off with the old
Spanish gold and silver utensils. What kind of adults
will develop out of the children to whom the desecration
of churches and the outraging of women are ordinary
sights; who, in tender years, see the streets red with
blood, and property arbitrarily passing into the hands of
those momentarily in power? The children seem the
pity of it, and it is a bitter fruit the next generation will
bear. Let him who can, take; and him who can, hold;
is the device the Constitutionalists really fly.</p>

<p>In the old days, before the Laws of Reform, there used
to be the most gorgeous religious processions; but even
now, with all that splendor in abeyance, there remains
something that is unsuppressed and unsuppressable. To-day
the population has streamed in and out of the
churches and visited the repositories (with their blaze of
light and bankings of orange-trees, roses, and lilies, and
countless varieties of beautiful palms), with all the ardor
of the old days. No restrictions can prevent the Indian
from being supremely picturesque at the slightest opportunity.</p>

<p>I went, as usual, to San Felipe, named after the Mexican
saint who, in the sixteenth century, found martyrdom
in Japan. It is just opposite the Jockey Club.
Outside the <i lang="es">zaguan</i>, on the chairs generally placed on
the pavement for the members, were sitting various
males of the smart set. All, without exception (I <em>think</em> I
could put my hand in the fire for them), had been to
Mass; which, however, didn’t prevent their usual close
scrutiny of the small, beautiful feet of the passing Mexican
women; two and one-half C is the usual size of a
Mexicana’s shoes.</p>

<p>This Casa de los Azujelos, where the Jockey Club has
had its being for generations, is a most lovely old house.
It is covered with beautiful blue-and-white Puebla tiles,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
appliquéd by an extravagant and æsthetic Mexican in
the seventeenth century, and is perfectly preserved, in
spite of the many kinds of <i lang="es">revolucionarios</i> who have
surged up the Avenida San Francisco, which, with the
<i lang="es">Paseo</i>, forms the thoroughfare between the <i lang="es">Palacio</i> and
Chapultepec. The men of the club play high and there
are stories of fabulous losses, as well as of occasional
shootings to death. It is the <i lang="fr">chic</i>, aristocratic club of
Mexico, the last and inviolable retreat of husbands. Anybody
who <em>is</em> any one belongs to it.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>A telegram from Dr. Ryan this morning reports:
“The Federals have lost Torreon. Velasco, retreating,
met Maure, Maass, and Hidalgo, at San Pedro; army
reorganized, and it is now attacking Torreon, and will
surely take it back.” He and von Papen got as far as
Saltillo by rail. There, communications had been cut.
There had been a big encounter at San Pedro de las
Colonias, and I hope that even as I write faithful Ryan
is proceeding with his work of mercy among the wounded.</p>

<p>There was a meeting at the Embassy to-day, to discuss
ways and means of defense among the Americans if anything
happens in the city. Von Hintze and von Papen
have tried to do some organizing among their colony.
The Japanese have long since had <i lang="fr">carte blanche</i> from the
government in the way of ammunition and marines from
their ships at Manzanillo. Sir Christopher, some time ago,
sent Lieutenant Strawbensie up from Vera Cruz, to teach
the English colony a few rudiments—and the French
have also had a naval officer here for several weeks.</p>

<p>Last night, it appears, the boat taking 480,000 pesos
to the north coast to pay the troops was captured by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
rebels. “Juan and José” always come out at the little
end of the horn. There are immense geographical difficulties
in the way of transporting money to the army
in the north, over mountain chains and deserts, besides the
strategic difficulty of getting it to the proper place
without the rebels or bandits seizing it. After that,
there is the further possibility of the officers putting it in
their own pockets. What wonder that “Juan and José”
sell their rifles and ammunition or go over to the rebels,
where looting is permitted and encouraged? <em>They</em> are
always hungry, no matter what are the intentions and
desires of the central government.</p>

<p>Telegrams from the north are very contradictory, and
generally unfavorable to the government. The foreign
correspondents were warned this morning, by a note
from the Foreign Office (and it was to be the last warning),
that they were not to send out false reports favorable
to the rebels and redounding to the injury of both
foreigners and Federals. They will get the famous
“33” applied to them, if they don’t “walk Spanish.”
No joking here now; much depends, psychologically, if
not actually, on the issues at Torreon.</p>

<p>The clever editor of the <cite>Mexican Herald</cite> remarks,
apropos of the Presidential message of last week: “Our
idea of a smart thing for Carranza to do would be to
read President Huerta’s message to Villa. The array of
things a President has to worry about, besides war and
confiscation, are enough to remove the glamour.”</p>

<p>All Villa knows about revenue is embodied in the
word loot. Even in this fertile land, where every mountain
is oozing with gold, silver, and copper, and every
seed committed to the earth is ready to spring up a
hundredfold, he who neglects to plant and dig can’t
reap or garner. The whole north is one vast devastation
and invitation to the specters of famine.</p>

incident”—Sabado de Gloria and Easter—An international photograph—The
last reception at Chapultepec.</p>


<h3><em>Viernes Santo Afternoon.</em></h3>

<p class="dropcap">As I came home from church this morning the sacred
day seemed to be a day of noise. The Indians were
busy in their booths along the Alameda. Thousands of
small, wooden carts are bought by thousands of small
boys and girls; <i lang="es">metracas</i>, they are called, and so constructed
that, in addition to the usual noise, every revolution
of the wheels makes a sound like the breaking of
wood. This noise is supposed to typify the breaking of
the bones of Judas. There are also appalling tin objects,
like nutmeg-graters, that revolve on sticks, with the
same symbolic sound. Little boys and girls outside the
churches sell pious leaflets, crying in their shrill voices,
“<i lang="es">Las siete palabras de nuestro Señor Jesus Christo</i>,” or
“<i lang="es">El pesame de nuestra Señora Madre de Dios</i>.”</p>

<p>Something is brewing here, and it was with a heart
somewhat perturbed by earthly happenings that I again
went to the cathedral, at three o’clock. At the doors
the little venders of the holy words were as insistent as
ever. Thousands were filing in and out, going up with
whatever burden of babe or bundle they happened to be
carrying, to kiss the great cross laid on the steps of the
high altar. I bethought me of last Good Friday in
Rome, and of hearing Father Benson preach the “Three
Hours” at San Sylvestro.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span></p>


<h3><em>April 10th. Good Friday Night.</em></h3>

<p>Events succeed each other in kaleidoscopic fashion in
Latin America, but I have, at last, a moment in which
to tell you of the especial turn to-day.</p>

<p>This morning N. was informed, through the Foreign
Office, of something referred to as “the Tampico incident.”
The Foreign Office was decidedly in the air about
it. On returning home, at one o’clock, however, N.
found a very definite telegram from Admiral Fletcher,
and there is sure to be trouble....</p>

<p>N. took the penciled reading and dashed off to find
Huerta. Potential war lies in any incident here. He was
away all the afternoon, hunting Huerta, but only found
him at six o’clock. Huerta’s written answer was in the
usual clever, Latin-American manner; his verbal remarks
on the subject to a foreigner were beyond editing.
The newspaper men were coming in, all the afternoon,
and were disappointed not to find the “source of light
and heat.”</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>The final touch was put on the nerves of everybody
by Elim’s dragging his <i lang="es">metraca</i> about the halls. With
howls of protestation he was separated from it.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>N. said he might possibly have arranged the matter
except for the little Sub-Secretary, who had never met the
President before, and who wanted, all during the interview,
to prove he was very much of a man. Portillo y
Rojas is away for the Easter holidays. At the President’s
door a big, sullen Indian told N. he could not see
the President, who was taking a <i lang="es">siesta</i>. As N. could not
entirely follow the injunction about sleeping dogs, he
compromised on a little tour, returning to find the
President about to get into his motor. He asked N.
to come with him, which N. did, sitting by his side, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
secretary facing them on the <i lang="es">strapontin</i>. N. told the
President he had something “very delicate” (“<i lang="es">un asunto
muy delicado</i>”) to speak to him about. The President
made one of his waving gestures, and the ball opened.
Huerta said he would apologize for “the Tampico
incident.” N. indicated that his government would
not consider that sufficient. Huerta asked, squarely:
“What do you want?” N. answered, “The salutes,”
saying he might arrange the matter quietly, giving
the salutes some morning at sunrise, for instance. The
President began to ponder the matter; whereupon the
secretary, thinking his chance had come, broke in upon
the silence with the remark that it would be derogatory
to the national honor to salute, and that there was no
guarantee that the salutes would be returned, that
Mexico’s sovereignty was in question, and the like.
The President immediately stiffened up.—So can a nobody
turn a nation’s destinies!</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>There is talk of providing a neutral zone in Tampico
during the fighting. Every time an oil-tank is damaged,
not only are several hundred thousand dollars gone, but
there is immense danger of the oil flowing down the river
and being set fire to. You can imagine the result to the
shipping in the harbor, as well as to the town.</p>

<p>It is now ten o’clock; the answer of Huerta has been
sent off to the State Department and to Admiral Fletcher.
Many newspaper men have interviewed Nelson, and he
has gone up-stairs. These days of delicate negotiations—when
a word too much or a word too little would make
trouble—are wearying, to say the least. But so is fame
made.... It seemed to me the only thing I <em>didn’t</em> do
to-day was to buy an imitation devil, also representing
Judas, of which thousands in clay, in cardboard, in every
conceivable form, are offered on every street corner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span></p>


<h3><i lang="es">Sabado de Gloria.</i></h3>

<p>To-day the <i lang="fr">papier-maché</i> “Judases” were burned, on
the street corners, to the great joy of children and
adults, while cannon and torpedoes and firecrackers of
all kinds made things rather noisy. I remembered again
the old Roman days, and the quiet of Holy Saturday,
“hidden in the tomb with Christ.”</p>

<p>There is going to be a lot of trouble about the Tampico
incident. The “Old Man” is recalcitrant and feels that
the public apology by General Zaragoza should be
sufficient. What we will do can only be surmised.
Recently, one of the newspapers had a cartoon of Mr.
Bryan speaking to “Mexico.” Under the picture was
this pleasing caption, “I may say, I am most annoyed;
and if you do not immediately reform, I hesitate to say
what I may not be inclined to decide, perhaps!”</p>


<h3><em>Easter Sunday Morning.</em></h3>

<p>A heavenly sky looks down on the Resurrection morn,
and it is, indeed, the resurrection of a good many Mexicans
who, these last days, have spilled their life’s blood
for reasons unknown to them. The Sub-Secretary for
Foreign Affairs spent the night hour from two to three
with Nelson. The Mexican government does not want
to salute the flag, though, of course, it will have to yield
to our demand. Fighting continues at Tampico. The
American war-ships are crowded with unfortunate refugees,
and there is increasing animosity against the
Americans. General Zaragoza has expressed official regret
at the arrest, but the salute to the flag has been
postponed.</p>

<p>Nelson has already been twice to the Foreign Office.
He told the sub-secretary to tell the President the salute
must be given. He has looked up precedents in the
international-law books at the Embassy, to soothe their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
feelings, their <i lang="es">cultura</i> and <i lang="es">bizarría</i>. If the sub-secretary
says that Huerta still persists in refusing, N. is going
to try a personal appeal. It is a salute or intervention,
I suppose.</p>

<p>It appears that Mr. Bryan has said he can see no
reason why the Mexican government should not “cheerfully
salute,” and “that doubtless the church holidays
have interfered with the transaction of business.” Is it
the end, or not? <i lang="es">Quién sabe?</i></p>


<h3><em>April 12th. 5</em> <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span></h3>

<p>A written reply, very clever indeed, was received at
one o’clock, refusing categorically to give the desired,
or rather, <em>demanded</em>, salute of twenty-one guns, at Tampico.
The Mexicans say that the whaleboat landed at
a part of the town then in the military zone, and without
permission; that fighting was going on at the time;
that the city was under martial law. The men had been
sent in to get gasoline for the ship with the paymaster
(usually it is only a petty officer who accompanies the
men on such errands). The reply ends with an <i lang="es">acuerdo
especial</i> (especial message) from Huerta to the effect that
he could not comply with the United States’ demands
without wounding Mexico’s national honor and dignity
and infringing on her sovereignty, which he is ready to
defend at all times and in all ways. Now what are we
going to do? The clerks have been working like mad
all day, and endless cables have gone out of the Embassy.
Nelson says he will not go to Huerta, though when we
passed Chapultepec restaurant, coming from the Reforma
Club near by, where we had been lunching, he
saw the President’s motor, and got out of our car and
strolled through the restaurant, to give Huerta a chance
to speak, if he was so minded, without seeking him
out. However, Huerta was dining with the officers of
the <em>rural</em> guard, and Nelson left immediately. Huerta<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
had been at the automobile races all the morning, we,
in our Anglo-Saxon preoccupation, having, of course, forgotten
about them. The situation is again very tense;
again war and destruction loom up—a specter to us, as
well as to this strange Indian republic that we are trying
to mold to our image and likeness.</p>

<p>Nelson has told all newspaper men that he gives no
information to any one; that he is a “dry spring,” and
that they must cable to their home offices for news. As,
since nine-thirty, there has been the strictest censorship,
they won’t get or give much. Even the Embassy cables
were delayed until Nelson went to the office and made
his arrangements.</p>

<p>The white pony and the Mexican saddle that the
President has asked to present to Elim, fortunately, have
not appeared. You can imagine the juicy dish of news
that gift would make at home! Refusal or acceptance
would be equally delicate.</p>


<h3><em>April 13th. Evening.</em></h3>

<p>No news has come. I wonder what they did in Tampico
at six o’clock. A very insistent note has come from
the Foreign Office, recounting, I think for the first time,
Mexico’s many grievances against us—troubles caused
by the raising of the embargo and the consequent
supplying of arms to the rebels; claiming the Federals’
right to conduct the fight at Tampico any way they see
fit; saying that they will tolerate no interference in their
national affairs, etc. We, having armed the rebels, can
hardly take exception to the Federals’ defending themselves.
They insist that the whaleboat of the <em>Dolphin</em>
<em>was</em> on forbidden territory when the men were arrested,
but the statement is not official. Washington is to-day
either finding a way out of the affair or looking into the
grim, cold eyes of intervention.</p>

<p>I had an Easter-egg hunt in the garden, for Elim, at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
which nine little darlings assisted. Then we had tea,
with many flashes of Spanish wit. All the foreign children
here prefer to speak Spanish. The mothers and other
ladies left at six, after which the French military <i lang="fr">attaché</i>,
de Bertier, and Letellier, came in, and we talked <i lang="es">Mexicana</i>
till eight. De Bertier said this was the second most
interesting situation he had ever watched. The first was
the beginning of the French power in Morocco—that
clear flame of French civilization, at first trembling and
uncertain, in the deserts and mountains of North Africa,
but ever increasing, carried to the Arabs, a “race pure,”
by a handful of brave and dashing soldiers, also of a
“race pure.” He finds the problem much more complicated
in Mexico, where a <i lang="fr">salade</i> of races is involved.</p>


<h3><em>April 14th. 2</em> <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span></h3>

<p>This morning, like so many mornings here, had its own
special color. Nelson had not seen Huerta since the
interview on Friday night, about the saluting of the
flag. We drove out to Chapultepec, where, before the
restaurant steps, the usual <i lang="fr">petit lever</i> was being held—generals,
Cabinet Ministers, and other officials. Nelson
went over to the President, while the motor, with
Clarence Hay and myself in it, retreated out of the blazing
sun under the shade of some convenient and beautiful
ahuehuetes. From afar we saw the President get out
of his motor and Nelson go up to him; then both walked
up the broad stairs of the restaurant. In a few minutes
Ramon Corona, now chief of staff, walked quickly over
to our motor.</p>

<p>“I come from the President to ask you to go to the
<i lang="es">fiesta militar</i> in the Pereda <i lang="es">cuartel</i>,” he said. The
President took Nelson in his motor, I following in ours,
with Corona. Hay vanished from the somewhat complicated
situation. I got to the barracks to find that we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
were the only foreigners, and I the only lady on the
raised dais (where generals and Cabinet Ministers were
even thicker than at Chapultepec), to watch the various
exercises the well-trained <i lang="es">gendarme</i> corps gave for the
President. They are for the moment without horses, the
lack of which is a great problem here. We watched the
various steps, drills, and exercises for a couple of hours
with great interest, I sitting between Corona and charming
young Eduardo Iturbide, the present governor of the
Federal district. It is wonderful what those Indians
did, having been gathered in only during the last month.
I told one or two little stories of things I had seen in
Berlin and Rome. You remember how the raw recruits
used to pass Alsenstrasse on the way to those big
barracks, just over the Spree—great, hulking, awkward,
ignorant peasants who after six weeks could
stand straight, look an officer in the eye, and answer
“Yes” or “No” to a question. The Italian story
was one once told me by a lieutenant who had been
drilling some recruits back of the Pamfili-Doria Villa.
After several weeks’ instruction, he asked a man,
“Who lives over there?” pointing to the Vatican.
“I don’t know,” was the answer. He called another
man, who responded, promptly, “The Pope.” The officer,
much encouraged, asked further, “What is his
name?” “Victor Emmanuele,” was the unhappy response.
This last story especially appealed to the officers.
They told me their greatest difficulty is to get any
kind of mental concentration from the Indians.</p>

<p>The exercises finally came to an end, with the Police
Band—one of the finest I have ever heard—playing the
waltz time of “Bachimba,” composed in honor of Huerta’s
great victory when fighting for Madero against
Orozco. Huerta gave me his arm and we went in to an
elaborate collation—champagne, cold <i lang="fr">patés</i>, and sweets—I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
sitting on the President’s right. Huerta then made
a speech that seemed as if it might have come from the
lips of Emperor William, on the necessity of discipline,
and the great results therefrom to the country. He said
that when the country was pacified the almost countless
thousands of the army would, he hoped, return to the
fields, the mines, the factories, stronger and better able to
fight the battle of life for having been trained to obedience,
concentration, and understanding. When the speech
was over, and all the healths had been drunk (mine coming
first!), the President gave the sign and I turned to
leave. We were standing in the middle of the flower-laden
horseshoe table, and I moved to go out by the
side I had come in. He stopped me.</p>

<p>“No, señora,” he said, “never take the road back—always
onward. <i lang="es">Adelante.</i>”</p>

<p>Repeating, “<i lang="es">Adelante</i>,” I took the indicated way.
As we went down the steps and into the <i lang="es">patio</i> we found
<em>four</em> cameras ready, about three yards in front of us!
I felt that Huerta was rather surprised, and I myself
stiffened up a bit, but—what could “a perfect lady” do?
It was not the moment for me to flinch, so we stood there
and let them do their worst. I could not show him the
discourtesy of refusing to be photographed—but here,
on the edge of war, it was a curious situation for us
both. Well, the <i lang="es">censura</i> can sometimes be a friend;
the photograph won’t be in every newspaper in the States
to-morrow. If, in a few days, diplomatic relations are
broken off, that will be an historic photograph.</p>

<p>The Old Man is always delightful in his courtesy and
tact. As for his international attitude, it has been flawless.
On all occasions where there has been any mistake
made it has been made by others, not by him. His
national political attitude has perhaps left “much to be
desired,” though I scarcely feel like criticizing him in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
any way. He has held up, desperately and determinedly,
the tattered fabric of this state and stands before the
world without a single international obligation. Who
has done anything for him? Betrayed at home and
neglected or handicapped abroad, he bears this whole
republic on his shoulders.</p>


<h3><em>5.30</em> <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span></h3>

<p>I am trembling with excitement. On getting out of
the motor, I met Hyde, of the <cite>Herald</cite>. He has just had
a telegram (the real sense made clear by reading every
other word—thus outwitting the censor) that the whole
North Atlantic fleet was being rushed to the Gulf, and
that a thousand marines were being shipped from Pensacola.
Hyde says that Huerta said to-day, “Is it a calamity?
No, it is the best thing that could happen
to us!”</p>

<p>I hear Hohler’s voice in the anteroom....</p>


<h3><em>April 14th. 6.30</em> <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span></h3>

<p>Burnside and Courts came in just after Hohler, and
the inevitable powwow on the situation followed. Burnside
says we all have the Mexico City point of view, and
perhaps we have. Hohler was very much annoyed at a
hasty pencil scrawl just received from the north, informing
him that Villa had confiscated many car-loads of
British cotton and that many cruelties to Spaniards had
been committed in connection with it. Certainly there
is not much “mine and thine,” in the Constitutionalist
territory, and not much protection. Here property and
life are respected.</p>

<p>There is a report that Huerta wants to send the “Tampico
incident” to The Hague for settlement. He insists
that he was in the right about the matter, and that
any impartial tribunal would give him justice. Be that
as it may, we know he must give the salutes. It only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
remains for him to find the way. <i lang="fr">Cherchez la formule</i>, if
not <i lang="fr">la femme</i>.</p>


<h3><em>April 15th.</em></h3>

<p>Another day, full to exhaustion, and winding up with
the reception at Chapultepec. There, while the President
and N. were conferring, we, the sixty or seventy
guests—Mexicans, plenipotentiaries, officials, civil and
military—waited from six o’clock until long after seven
to go in to tea, or “lunch,” as they call it here. Beyond
occasional glances at the closed doors, no impatience was
manifested. All know these are the gravest and most
delicate negotiations. We whiled away the time on the
palm-banked terrace, listening to the music of a band of
<i lang="es">rurales</i>, who made a picturesque mass in their orange-colored
clothes embroidered in silver, with neckties so
scarlet that they were almost vermilion, and great, peaked,
white felt hats, with a heavy cord around the crown
of the same color as the flaming cravats. They sat in
one corner of the great terrace, playing their national
music most beautifully—dances full of swing, or melancholy
and sensuous airs of the people, on zithers, mandolins,
guitars, harps, and some strange, small, gourd-like
instruments played as one would play on a mandolin.</p>

<p>At last the President and N. came in, looking inscrutable.
No time to ask results now. The President gave
his arm to me, and he then wanted N. to take in Madame
Huerta; but the <i lang="fr">chef du protocol</i> headed off this rather
too-close co-operation, saying that was the place
of the Russian minister. I talked to Huerta to the limit
of my Spanish, with pacific intent, but he kept glancing
about in a restless way. I even quoted him that line of
Santa Teresa, “<i lang="es">La paciencia todo lo alcanza</i>.” He
asked me, abruptly, what I thought of his international
attitude, and before I could reply to this somewhat
difficult question he fortunately answered it himself.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
“Up to now,” he said, “I have committed no faults, I
think, in my foreign policy; and as for patience, I am
made of it.” He added, “I keep my mouth shut.”
I changed the subject, too near home for comfort, by
telling him that his speech of yesterday, to the troops,
might have been made by the Emperor of Germany.
I thought that would send his mind somewhat afield;
you know he loves Napoleon, and would be willing to
include the Kaiser. He brightened up and thanked me
for the compliment, in the way any man of the world
might have done.... It is a curious situation. I have
all the time a sickening sensation that we are destroying
these people and that there is no way out. We seem to
have taken advantage of their every distress.</p>

<p>We hurried away at eight o’clock, so that N. might
see Courts at the station, and give him the summary of
his conversation, to be repeated to Admiral Fletcher.
It was that Huerta would be willing to give the salutes
if he could <em>trust</em> us to keep our word about returning
them. As he certainly has no special reason for any
faith in our benevolence, he finally stipulated that the
twenty-one salutes be fired simultaneously. N. said he
was very earnest and positive during the first part of the
conversation, but that toward the end he seemed more
amenable. Heaven alone knows how it will all end.
One thing is certain—it is on the lap of the gods and of
Huerta, and the issue is unknown to the rest of us.</p>

<p>I got home from the station to find Mrs. Burnside
in the drawing-room, ready to spend the evening. The
captain was down-stairs, with what he afterward characterized
as “blankety blanks” (willing, but unmechanical
civilians), who were helping him to set up the rapid-firing
guns, otherwise known as the “doves of peace.”
Mrs. Burnside tried to persuade me to go to Vera Cruz
to-morrow, when she departs, but I couldn’t, in conscience,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
cause a probably unnecessary stampede of people
from their comfortable homes. If I had taken advantage
of the various opportunities held out to flee, I would
have had, in common with many others, an uncomfortable
winter <i lang="fr">à cheval</i> between Mexico City and the “Villa
Rica de la Vera Cruz.”</p>

<p>I don’t know what answer has been made to the
Hague proposition, if any, by Washington; but it must
have staggered Mr. Bryan and caused him to blink.
The Hague is one of the dearest children of his heart, and
universal peace has ever been a beloved and fruitful
source of eloquence. When it confronts him at this special
moment, can he do otherwise than take it to his
bosom?</p>


<h3><em>April 16th.</em></h3>

<p>This morning things seemed very bad. A curious telegram
came from Mr. Bryan, to be given to the press
for its private information, not yet for publication, saying
that the Tampico incident was quite in the background,
but reciting two recent and heinous crimes of
Mexico. First, a cable for the Embassy was held over by
a too-zealous partisan of the <i lang="es">censura</i> at the cable-office.
N. arranged that matter in two minutes, over the telephone,
when it was brought to the attention of the
cable authorities. Hohler happened, for Mexico’s good,
to be with N. at the time. The incident was less than
nothing, until mentioned in the open cable from Washington.
The other incident, also well enough known,
happened a short time ago in Vera Cruz, where another
too-zealous official arrested an orderly in uniform, carrying
the mails between the ships and the Vera Cruz post-office.
That matter was dismissed after an apology, a
nominal punishment of the offending official, and the
immediate release of the carrier. Admiral Fletcher attached
no importance to the affair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span></p>

<p>I have not cited the incidents in order. The telegram
for the press, in referring to the cable incident, begins,
“far more serious is the withholding by the censor of a
cable addressed to the <i lang="fr">chargé d’affaires</i> of the United
States.” It also points out that no like incidents have
happened to the representatives of other nations in Mexico,
and that we must protect our national dignity—to
which I respond with all my heart. But when we do
intervene here—which I know we must—let it be for
some vital case of blood and destruction. The day
Huerta has a stroke of apoplexy, gets a knife in his back,
or is killed by a firing-squad, we must come in, for
anarchy will reign. He may not be the best man in the
world, and clever and even profound thoughts of one
day are counterbalanced by ineptitudes of the next;
but he does seem to be the only man in Mexico who can
and will keep order in the provinces under his control,
especially now that the best and most conservative elements
are associated with the task—Rincon Gaillardo,
Iturbide, Garcia Pimentel, and many others.</p>

<p>Not a word of all the happenings of the past few days
has appeared in any newspaper in Mexico. The great
potentialities are hidden, like a smoldering, unsuspected
fire. There <em>is</em> a throbbing, an unrest—but the
great public doesn’t yet know whence it comes.
I think if N. has any luck in his pacific endeavors he
ought to have the Nobel prize—though I understand
his <i lang="fr">chef direct</i> has an eye on that.</p>


<h3><em>April 17th.</em></h3>

<p>Last night N. was with the Minister for Foreign Affairs
for several hours. They finally tracked Huerta to his
house. The orderly said he had gone to bed, but the
Minister sent in his card. After a wait of half an hour
he sent in another. Huerta had forgotten that he was
waiting. He received him in bed, and in the midst of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
conversation asked him, as he afterward told N., what
he thought about his pajamas, adding, with a grin, that
they were <em>Japanese</em>. Nelson did not go in. He had
spent several hours with the President at various times
during the day, and did not want to see him about painful
and irritating matters at such a late hour, when he
and the President were worn out.</p>

<p>In thinking over Huerta’s remark, a few days ago,
about the demonstrations of our fleet not being a calamity,
I believe he means that this is, after all, the best way
of consolidating the Federal troops. We may stiffen them
to service of their country against a common enemy—but,
oh, the graft! Oh, the dishonesty and self-seeking
that animate many of the hearts beating under those
uniforms! They sell anything and everything to the
highest bidder, from automobile tires and munitions of
war, to their own persons. As for punishing the various
officers that are guilty, it seems very difficult;
court-martials would mean the decamping to the rebels
of many officers, high and low. So when <em>we</em> demand
punishment of this or that official, the “Old Man” is
placed between the devil and the deep sea. It is a position
he should now be accustomed to, however. On
spies or on those conspiring against the government he
is relentless. That all political colors recognize, and they
do not hold it against him. Apropos of going over to the
rebels, the Mazatlan incident of last Christmas (or January
first) is a case in point. The officers on the gunboat
<em>Tampico</em> in the harbor had a scandalous debauch,
with stabbings, etc. They were to be court-martialed,
but they got out of that difficulty by going over, boat
and all, to the Constitutionalists at Topolobampo!</p>

<h3><em>April 17th.</em></h3>

<p class="dropcap">Washington will not take The Hague into consideration,
and will not fire simultaneous salutes,
which, of course, it would be childish for us to do, so the
question is narrowed down to one point:—the Mexicans
must salute our flag, and we engage ourselves to answer
it. Many precedents for this are being cited by foreigners
here. For instance, the celebrated case of the French
consul in San Francisco, who was jailed for a few hours
through a mistake. We made all reparation and engaged
ourselves to fire twenty-one salutes to the first
French ship that came into the harbor. Kanya tells me
of an incident that transpired when he was <i lang="fr">chargé d’affaires</i>
at Cettinje, that was regulated by an exchange of
salutes between the contending parties, in Antivari
harbor.</p>

<p>I have had calls all afternoon—German, Belgian,
Austrian, and Italian colleagues, Marie Simon, de Soto
(looking more like a handsome contemporary of Velasquez
than ever)—all, of course, talking about <i lang="es">la

has been out since four o’clock, trying to communicate
the very courteous, but firm, answer of Washington
cited above.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span></p>


<h3><em>Later.</em></h3>

<p>N. came in for dinner as the Burnsides, d’Antin, and
McKenna were sitting with me at table. One of the
numerous telephone calls proved to be from the Minister
for Foreign Affairs, saying that he was leaving the Ministerio,
and would be immediately at the Embassy. I had
cognac and cigarettes placed in the drawing-room, and
then everybody got out of the way. They are both in
there now—9.45—and the fate of Mexico hangs in the
balance, in that pleasant, high-ceilinged <i lang="fr">salon</i> of mine,
with the big vases of long-stemmed pink geraniums, and
books, and photographs, and bibelots, and its deep,
comfortable green leather chairs and sofa. I am writing
this in one of the smaller rooms, with newspaper men
running in and out, and the telephone ringing. To the
journalistic demands Nelson has told the clerks to say
“there is no change,” which, in spite of my excitement,
or perhaps because of it, reminds me of the story recounted
of a Russian Ambassador to London. His wife
had the bad taste to die at the time of the great visit of
the Czar to Queen Victoria. The Ambassador, who was
above everything a diplomat, had the body put on ice in
the cellar of the Embassy, and to all inquiries as to his
wife’s health he replied, suavely: “Thank you; madame
is in the same condition.”</p>


<h3><em>11.30.</em></h3>

<p>Back in the drawing-room, with the historic cognac,
the equally historic cigarette ash, and the drawn-up
chairs as mute witnesses that something has taken
place. What will come of it all? Rocking the ship of
state is an exciting business. I don’t understand Huerta’s
attitude, unless he is whipped by the rebels, and <em>knows</em>
it, and prefers defeat at the hands of a nobler foe.</p>

<p>Portillo y Rojas said the President felt that he had done
all that he was called on to do as chief of the nation to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
expiate the Tampico incidents; that the sailors were
put at liberty immediately, with an apology given by
the <i lang="es">jefe de la plaza</i>—General Moreles Zaragoza—to
Admiral Mayo; that since then the President himself
had manifested regret and had ordered an investigation
to punish the guilty party; that any nation in the world
would have been satisfied by these proceedings, and that
furthermore he agreed that the Mexican cannon might salute
simultaneously with those of the Americans, which
would fully show the good-will on both sides, and also
let the neighboring peoples witness the happy termination
of a difficulty that had never been serious. There is
a Spanish proverb about having more fins than a fish,
which certainly applies to this sauve and clever old
Indian. He further sent expressions of great friendship
for Nelson by the Minister, but said he <em>couldn’t</em> do this
thing even for him, much as he desired to.</p>

<p>A moment ago a little blond-headed, blue-robed,
sleepy angel appeared on the scene to ask when I was
coming up-stairs. Perhaps, like the rest of us, Elim
feels the disturbing electric currents in the air. He is
now lying on the sofa, wrestling with sleep. He had been
put to bed some hours before, rather unhappily. He
kept pressing close to my dressing-table as I was getting
ready for dinner, fingered every article on it, and
asked me countless questions. These ranged from,
“What does God eat?” to, “Why don’t women wear suspenders?”
until I was frantic and had him removed in
tears.</p>

<p>There are fears that the Zapatistas will arrive in the
city; but they are nothing compared to other fears
that stalk the town to-night. During the French intervention
many people remained in Mexico City,
reached a ripe old age, and died in their beds; which
every one seems anxious to do, though I have never felt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
that dying in one’s bed is all it is cracked up to be.
“Bury me where I fall. Everywhere will be heard the
judgment call.” I don’t much care when or where or how
it comes.</p>


<h3><em>April 18th. 4:30</em> <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span></h3>

<p>No news as yet from Washington. I have just returned
after lunching at the Russian minister’s. Everything
was very <i lang="fr">soigné</i>, as it always is, with <i lang="ru">blinis</i> and
delicious caviar and all sorts of good things. I feel as
if I had eaten the Legation instead of at it. One has
so little appetite at eight thousand feet above sea-level.
There were von Hintze, Kanya, Marie Simon, in one of
her smart Drecoll dresses, and myself. They all think
the situation in the south is very bad, but I am no more
to be scared by the cry of Zapatistas, having heard it
ever since I first put foot in Mexico.</p>

<p>The <cite>Mexican Herald</cite> remarks this morning (dealing
with the situation in glittering generalities) that “When
each party to an agreement gets the idea that the other
side is going to back down, it is certainly trying to the
patience of an <em>Irish</em> peacemaker.”</p>

<p>One of the great dust-storms of the end of the dry
season is on us to-day; all the color is gone out of the
air, which has become opaque, gritty, non-refracting.</p>


<h3><em>6.30.</em></h3>

<p>Callers all the afternoon. Now McKenna comes in
to say that the final word, <i lang="fr">en clair</i>, from Washington
has been received. It was given out at the White House
at noon. “General Huerta is still insisting upon doing
something less than has been demanded, and something
less than could constitute an acknowledgment that his
representatives were entirely in the wrong in the indignities
they have put upon the United States. The
President has determined that if General Huerta has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
not yielded by six o’clock on Sunday afternoon, he
will take the matter to Congress on Monday.”</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>It makes me sick with dread to think of the probable
fate of Americans in the desert spaces and the mountain
fastnesses of Mexico. Some one has blundered, somewhere,
somehow, that <em>we</em> should come in to give the
<i lang="fr">coup de grâce</i> to this distracted nation, who yet clings,
and rightly, to those tattered shreds of sovereignty we
have left her. The foreign Powers think we are playing
the most cold-blooded, most cruel game of “grab” in all
history.</p>


<h3><em>April 18th. 10</em> <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span></h3>

<p>Things <em>do</em> move. I came down from Aunt Laura’s room
to find Lieutenant Rowan in the hall, just off the train
from Vera Cruz, after a delayed, dusty trip. You can imagine
he got a warm welcome. Nelson came in just then,
and a few minutes later, as we were still standing in the
front hall, Portillo y Rojas appeared at the door, looking,
we instantly thought, much happier. He was wearing his
green, gold-embroidered sash, the insignia of military
rank that Huerta has imposed rather than bestowed on
all Cabinet officers, who are thus under military discipline
and obedience to him as <i lang="es">generalissimo</i>. They objected
to wearing full military uniform, compromising
on the sash. Rojas also wore a smile—I don’t know
whether it was for me or for the situation. He had come
to tell Nelson that the salutes would be given on his,
N.’s, written word of honor that they would be returned.
He has been an hour and a half in Nelson’s private room
drawing up a document—a protocol (<i lang="fr">il y va de sa propre
tête</i>)—and he is doing it with the painstaking care of a
man who has everything at stake. Nelson himself is
pretty foxy, and has to look out for <em>his</em> skin. Well,
“all’s well that ends well.” If we get through this the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
next incident <em>will</em> mean war. I hope at Washington
they will appreciate some of the difficulties N. has to
meet, and act accordingly. However, “call no man
happy until his death.” I hear the click of the big iron
gate swinging to after the exit of Lopez Portillo y Rojas.</p>

<p>I am fairly tired out and shall now proceed to draw the
drapery of my couch about me and lie down—I hope to
pleasanter dreams than those of last night. How glad
I am that I haven’t confided my son or my jewels
to various terror-stricken acquaintances who have levanted
two hundred and fifty miles <em>east</em> and eight thousand
feet down. It hasn’t come yet; all, after everything
is said and done, hangs on the life of that astute and patient
old Cori Indian, whose years of our Lord are fifty-nine,
and who, whatever his sins, were they blacker
than night, is legally President of Mexico. Chase
legality out of Latin America and where are you? After
him anarchy, chaos, and finally intervention—the biggest
police job ever undertaken in the Western Hemisphere,
however one may feel like belittling it from a military
standpoint. I have thought all these days of the probable
head-lines of the newspapers and hoped my precious
mother was not worrying about her distant ones. Good
night, and then again good night. “God’s in His heaven;
all’s well with <em>us</em>.”</p>


<h3><em>April 19th. 11.30</em> <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span></h3>

<p>The last of the continuous line of plenipotentiaries,
<i lang="fr">chargés d’affaires</i>, railroad men, laymen of all kinds, have
gone. Washington refused Nelson’s signature to the
protocol drawn up by Portillo y Rojas and sent for approval.
Huerta then refused categorically to give the
salutes. So it is intervention. At 4.30 I went down-stairs
for tea, as usual, to find Adatchi and Eyguesparsse
there. Eyguesparsse, as you know, married the sister
of General Rincon Gaillardo. He says that Huerta<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
will resist to the end; his <i lang="fr">esprit militaire</i> is entirely opposed
to the <i lang="fr">esprit universitaire</i> of Wilson. “<i lang="es">Ils ne pourront
jamais se comprendre.</i>” Huerta said to Rincon
Gaillardo that intervention would be a work of five years,
and productive of the greatest trouble to the United
States. Huerta’s stand is <i lang="es">incroyable</i>, <i lang="es">unglaublich</i> unbelievable,
<i lang="es">incredibile</i>—what you will. Each representative
who called exclaimed the same thing in his special tongue
as he greeted me. Hohler was very quiet, and really very
sad at the happenings. He has been a faithful friend
through everything. Sir Lionel gets here to-morrow or
the next day. Kanya, Letellier, and Clarence Hay
stayed for dinner. Hohler came back again in the evening,
also von Hintze, who does not think the war vote
will go with a rush through Congress to-morrow, and
quotes the case of Polk. He said it took three months
for him to persuade Congress to vote the money and
men for the 1846 war. I can’t verify this. He and
von Papen left at eleven. Nelson, Rowan, and I came
up-stairs, all a bit fagged. To-morrow will be a full day.
I long ago promised the American women here that if
and when I thought the break was impending I would
let them know. I think it has steadied their situation
here that I haven’t “lit out” from time to time. But
what of the hundreds—no, thousands—all over this fair
land whose possible fate is scarcely to be looked in the
face? The “Old Man” has some idea other than despair
and fatigue or impatience. He is working on a plan,
probably hoping for a chance to play his trump card—the
unification of all Mexicans to repel the invaders,—which
would take the trick anywhere but in Mexico.
We are going to get some more <i lang="es">gendarmes</i> for the Embassy.
I feel very calm and deeply interested. It is a
big moment, and Nelson has been unremitting in his endeavors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span></p>

<p>The Foreign Office here has given the press a statement
of two thousand words to-night, which will bring
forth dismay and horror in the morning. I can’t feel
the personal danger of the situation. I am sorry dear Dr.
Ryan is away. I sent him yesterday, in care of the
consul at Saltillo, the prearranged word, “101,” which
meant that, whenever, wherever, he got it, he was to return
immediately. At last hearing, the more prudent
von Papen, who decided to return to Mexico City, saw
him start from Saltillo with his medical supplies and
four mules, to try to get to Torreon over a desert stretch.</p>

<p>Von Papen, who had a most uncertain trip, says the
only way to prevent the continual destruction of the
railways is the establishment of the blockhouse system
now planned by the Federal government.</p>


<h3><em>2.30</em> <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span></h3>

<p>I can’t sleep. National and personal potentialities
are surging through my brain. Three stalwart railroad
men came to the Embassy this evening. They brought
reports of a plan for the massacre of Americans in the
street to-night, but, strange and wonderful thing, a
heavy rain is falling. It is my only experience of a midnight
rain in Mexico, except that which fell upon the
mobs crying “Death to Diaz,” nearly three years ago.
As all Mexicans hate to get wet, rain is as potent as
shell-fire in clearing the streets, and I don’t think there
will be any trouble. Providence seems to keep an occasional
unnatural shower on hand for Mexican crises.</p>

<p>N.’s secret-service man reappeared upon the scene yesterday,
probably by the President’s orders. This works
two ways. It protects N., and incidentally proves to
Huerta that N. is not intriguing against <em>him</em>.</p>

<p>Had this war been induced by a great incident or for
a great principle, I could bear it. But because the details
of a salute could not be decided upon we give ourselves,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
and inflict on others, the horrors of war. Mr.
Bryan, so the <cite>Herald</cite> playfully remarks to-day, must
have been surprised and disappointed. The “salutes
were always so cheerfully returned at Chautauqua.”
It is no situation for amateurs. The longer I live the
more respect I have for technical training. Every Foreign
Office in Europe or any other continent keeps experts
for just such cases. I may become an interventionist,
but <em>after</em> Huerta. He has proved himself vastly
superior, in executive ability, to any man Mexico has
produced since Diaz, in spite of his lack of balance and
his surprising childishness, following upon strange subtleties,
and he would have sold his soul to please the
United States to the point of recognition. In that small,
soft hand (doubtless bloody, too) were possibilities of a
renewal of prosperity, after the dreams of Madero that
he himself could never have clothed in reality. The reassociation
of the government with the conservative elements
might have given some guarantee of peace, at
least during Huerta’s life, and any man’s life is a long
time in an Indian or Latin republic.</p>


<h3><em>April 20th. 10</em> <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span></h3>

<p>We have awakened to a busy morning. At seven
o’clock I began to telephone all those women. If anything
happens, American women here will be thankful to
be out of the way, and if the clouds blow over, they will
only have done what they have done before, on several
occasions—taken an unnecessary trip to Vera Cruz.
Every American in town has either appeared at the Embassy
or telephoned. Rowan remains with us, I hope.
N. has telegraphed Admiral Fletcher that in view of the
fact that he is alone with me at the Embassy, he begs not
to have Rowan recalled. He is a dear fellow, and a great
comfort and support. Anything his courage and good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
sense can keep from happening to us will not happen.
A cable saying the matter will be laid before Congress
this afternoon, instead of this morning, is just received.
It gives us a breathing-space. But the telephone! The
newspaper men! The frightened Americans! If we are
obliged to go, Aunt Laura will stay with Mrs. Melick,
that friend of hers who has a handsome house just across
the way. This relieves both her and me from anxiety.
Americans are leaving in hosts—about five hundred persons,
of all nationalities, leave to-day.</p>

<p>I have just found on my table an envelope, “From
Elim to Mamma.” A drawing inside represents a tombstone,
and a star shines above it. It has a little bunch
of fresh heliotrope fastened to it with a clipper, and the
back is decorated with three crosses—a bit startling in
these potential days! My heart is sick. Wednesday
that great fleet arrives. What is it going to fight? It
can’t bombard Vera Cruz. The streets are full and the
houses overflowing with fleeing non-combatants. It
can’t climb the mountains and protect the countless
Americans getting their living in the fastnesses or in the
valleys. Huerta’s army is engaged in the death-struggle,
in the north, against enemies of the government, armed
with our munitions. Oh, the pity of it!</p>

<p>And this city, this beautiful city, placed so wonderfully,
so symmetrically, on the globe, in the very center
of the Western Hemisphere, a great continent to north
and south, half-way between immense oceans, and lifted
nearly eight thousand feet up to the heavens! Strange,
symbolic correspondences between the seen and the unseen
constantly make themselves sensible, in some unexplainable,
magic way, while to the eye there are the manifold
abundancies of mother earth, and this queer, dark,
unchanging, and unchangeable race, whose psychological
formula is unknown to us, inhabiting and using it all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span></p>


<h3><em>April 20th. 7.30.</em></h3>

<p>This afternoon a whirlwind of rumors. First, that
Congress had voted full power to Mr. Wilson, and one
hundred and fifty million dollars; that Vera Cruz was being
bombarded; that an attack is being planned against
the Embassy to-night. There is, doubtless, nothing in
this last, but N. telephoned to Eduardo Iturbide, always
to be counted on, who is sending us one hundred mounted
<i lang="es">gendarmes</i>. Captain Burnside is coming over here to
sleep, and Rowan is with us, besides secret-service men
and our own <i lang="es">gendarmes</i>. We have machine-guns, rifles,
and quantities of ammunition. Many people were in for
tea, when I am always to be seen. Madame Simon expects
to leave to-night for Vera Cruz, with her little boy
and two maids. Clarence Hay and the Tozzers are going,
too, and about one hundred Germans. Von Hintze
has sent away as many men, women, and children as he
could induce to go.</p>

<p>I had a curious experience with Adatchi. Suddenly,
as he was sitting on the sofa, drinking his tea, von Papen
and Ayguesparsse also in the room, I had a queer
psychic impression that he was not speaking of what he
was thinking. I thought no more of it until he came over
to a chair near me and said, with a curious, Oriental
smile:</p>

<p>“I had a talk with Portillo y Rojas, this afternoon.
All is not yet lost. I have left my secretaries working on
a long telegram to Tokio.”</p>

<p>I asked: “You mean there may be a possible arrangement?”</p>

<p>And he said, “Yes,” without enlarging on it. N. is out,
calling on Iturbide to thank him for the guard, and
Adatchi returns at nine-thirty. After he left, I told
Ayguesparsse and von Papen what Adatchi had said.</p>

<p>Ayguesparsse said, “His government would naturally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
favor the Mexicans.” And we all wondered if the Japs
<em>could</em> have worked out an <em>arreglamiento</em>. The Japanese
<i lang="fr">mentalité</i> is, of course, absolutely foreign and irreconcilable
to ours, but it is <em>not</em> a negligible quantity. Ayguesparsse
has been very, very nice all these days, and I realize
that behind that elegant silhouette there is a man of
poise and kindness. Scarcely had he and von Papen
departed when Hohler came in, hoping still for some
arrangement. In this dark hour every one of the colleagues
has shown himself sincerely desirous of some
issue being found. So you have a little of my day, full
of a thousand other things. Many people have urged
me to depart with them, but I am not nervous, not
afraid. I am no trouble to N., perhaps even some help;
and certainly dignity and all manner of fitness demand
that I remain here with him till he gets his papers, <em>if</em> he
gets them, and go off suitably at the time appointed by
our country, or the country to which we are accredited.
My leaving now would mean to the Americans here that
all was lost—even honor, <em>I</em> should add. Elim has not
been far out of sight to-day. He was warned, and the
<i lang="es">gendarmes</i> and everybody in the house warned, that he
was not even to look out of the gate; and, scenting possible
danger, he has not wandered far afield. He climbs
into my chair, trots after me, looks in at the door—he
has no intention of being out of call if suddenly wanted.
His little senses are alert, and he knows that all is not
quiet on the plateau.</p>


<h3><em>April 21st.</em></h3>

<p>Instead of an attack, last night, everything was very
peaceful. The automobile squad, composed of willing
and capable Americans, circled continually about the
Embassy, as well as the guard of one hundred mounted
<i lang="es">gendarmes</i> Eduardo Iturbide sent us. A bare message
came from Washington, very late, saying that Congress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
had voted the President full powers. The details we
will doubtless get this morning. The <em>Ypiranga</em>, of the
Hamburg-American Line, arrives at Vera Cruz to-day,
with seventeen million rounds of ammunition for Huerta,
which will greatly complicate matters. I do not know if
we are going to seize it or not. If we do, it is an <i lang="fr">acte de
guerre</i>, and we will be out of here on short notice. If
one were convinced of the good-will of Washington, this
whole incident could be arranged in five minutes. The
Mexican Foreign Office published this morning the full
text of the documents on the Tampico incident. The
officials feel there is nothing to conceal, and the diplomats
and every American in town have by now lapped
up with their coffee all the secrets of the situation.</p>

<p class="chapblock">Vera Cruz taken—Anti-American demonstrations—Refugees at the Embassy—A
long line of visitors—A dramatic incident in the cable-office—Huerta
makes his first and last call at the Embassy.</p>


<h3><em>April 21st. 12.30.</em></h3>

<p class="dropcap">Nelson has been informed through Mexican sources—a
most embarrassing way to get the news—that
Vera Cruz was taken by our ships at eight o’clock this
morning. (Cortés landed on April 21st, if I am not mistaken,
though, of course, that isn’t much help to <em>us</em> now!)
The line from Mexico City to Vera Cruz has been blown
up. I am so worn out that I wouldn’t mind seeing even
the Zapatistas climbing in at the windows. Aunt Laura
has been sitting by my bed, wearing that pale-blue
woolen jacket you sent me. She feels, after all these
decades of Tehuantepec, a chill even in these lovely
days. The situation she will find herself in after we go
appalls me, but she is determined to remain. All these
years she has watched the increasing glories and securities
of Don Porfirio’s Mexico. One could go unarmed
from the Rio Grande to Guatemala. Now, when the
years begin to press upon her, she is caught up and
ruined by present-day Mexican uncertainties, or rather,
certainties. One <em>knows</em> one will lose everything one has
here.</p>

<p>N. just looked in at the door to say we may have to
leave <i lang="la">via</i> the Pacific (Manzanillo and San Francisco).
Well, it is all in the hands of the Lord. Some time, some
way, we are destined to be recalled from Mexico City.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
I wonder what Huerta is thinking of doing this morning.
Will the situation weld together his divided people?
I am thankful not to be among the hundreds—no,
thousands—without bank accounts in New York, Chicago,
Boston, or other places, who are being packed like
sardines on transports for “home.” These are the real
tragedies of the situation to us, though I can’t help
thinking of the Mexican side. Several hundred thousand
men, women, and children have been killed in various
ways since Madero started for Mexico City—American
gunners manning his guns.</p>


<h3><em>April 21st. 5 o’clock.</em></h3>

<p>No news from Washington to-day. We might all be
massacred. It is due to the essential meekness, want of
national spirit, want of whatever you will in the Mexicans,
that we are not, not because a paternal government
is watching over its public servants in foreign parts.
I have sent out for a good supply of candles; the lights
might be cut to-night by some Zapatista band. We all
wonder why Huerta hasn’t cut the railroad to Vera
Cruz. Why doesn’t he make things a bit nasty for us?</p>


<h3><em>8</em> <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span></h3>

<p>A word from my sofa, where I am resting in my purple
Paris draperies. We have had a long line of visitors.
Ayguesparsse was the first, and so nice and sympathetic.
With his Mexican wife he does not find himself in an
easy position. His family-in-law has made many and
real sacrifices for <i lang="es">La Patria</i> and the Huerta government.
Three men, expert machinists, are having their dinners
down-stairs, having set up the Gatling-guns under Burnside’s
instructions. I have provided <i lang="es">pulque</i>, <i lang="es">tortillas</i>,
<i lang="es">frijoles</i>, and cigarettes for countless <i lang="es">gendarmes</i>. We are
ten at dinner, and perhaps twenty have been in for tea.
There has been an anti-American demonstration at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
Porter’s Hotel, where the very clever woman journalist
I mentioned before is staying. She will sleep here to-night,
in Ryan’s room. The landlady of Porter’s is also
coming, and they will have to take friendly turns in
a single bed. About twenty extra persons are sleeping
here. We hear nothing from Washington direct. Algara,
the Mexican <i lang="fr">chargé</i>, has been recalled. N. saw
Huerta this afternoon, who begged him not to go. We
can no longer cable, though the other legations can send
what they like to Washington <i lang="la">via</i> their various European
chanceries. No trains are going out to-night nor this
morning. Three of the many Pullmans, loaded with men,
women, and children, which started yesterday for Vera
Cruz, have not yet arrived there. We understand there
was fighting along the road.</p>

<p>Rowan is being more than nice, but I think he is rather
longing for the baptism of fire that <em>might</em> be his, were
he in Vera Cruz.</p>

<p>After dinner McKenna came to tell us that there were
three car-loads of women and children outside the Embassy
gate. They had to come in, of course, and be
attended to.</p>

<p>Nelson saw Huerta to-day at his house. The President
said to him, very brusquely: “You have seized our
port. You have the right to take it, if you can, and we
have the right to try to prevent you. <i lang="es">Su Excelencia el
Señor Presidente</i> Wilson has declared war, unnecessarily,
on a people that only ask to be left alone, to follow out
their own evolution in their own way, though it may not
seem to you a good way.” He added that he would have
been willing to give the salutes, but that the incident
was only a pretext. In three weeks or three months, he
said, it would have been something else; that we were
“after him,” or the Spanish to that effect.</p>

<p>I think his real idea is to form the Mexicans into one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
camp against the foreign foe. He does not want Nelson
to go, in spite of the fact that Algara has been recalled.
We have no intimation, as yet, of our leaving. Mr.
Bryan has stated that he instructed Mr. O’Shaughnessy
to see Huerta and ask him to keep the roads open to
facilitate the getting out of refugees. We are asking
favors to the end. N. had not seen the President for
several days and did not know in what disposition he
would find him. But Huerta took his hand and greeted
him, saying, “<i lang="es">Como está, amigo?</i>” (“How are you,
friend?”). He might have been going to play some
Indian trick on him. I begged Rowan to go with N.,
and he waited in the automobile while N. had the interview.</p>


<h3><em>Later.</em></h3>

<p>We are at war. American and Mexican blood flowed
in the streets of Vera Cruz to-day. The tale that
reaches us is that the captain of the <em>Ypiranga</em> tried to
land the seventeen million rounds of ammunition. Admiral
Fletcher expostulated. The captain of the <em>Ypiranga</em>
insisted on doing it, and, as we were not at
war, he was within his international rights. The
admiral prevented him by force, and, they say, in order
to justify the action imposed on him by Washington, took
the town—thus putting us on a war basis. Whether this
is a true version of what has happened I don’t know. It
does not sound like Admiral Fletcher, but he may have
had definite orders from Washington. Von Hintze came
in this afternoon. He minimized the incident, or rather,
seemed to minimize it, but I could see that he was very
much preoccupied. It may be a source of other and graver
complications than those of Mexico. It has been
many a year since American blood flowed in the streets
of Vera Cruz. General Scott took it in 1847. The endless
repetitions of history!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span></p>


<h3><em>11</em> <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span></h3>

<p>As I write, a mob, rather inoffensive, is howling outside,
waving Mexican flags and exhorting in loud voices.
I can’t hear anything from the window except something
about <i lang="es">Vivan los Japoneses</i>, and a few remarks not flattering
to <i lang="es">los Gringos</i>. There are many good and capable
Americans, willing, ready, and able to second any use
of the guns. N. and Rowan have gone down to the cable-office
to try and send off something to Washington. The
silence of our government remains unbroken. Sir Lionel
came back this morning. He is soon to go to Rio.
How beautifully England treats <em>her</em> diplomats! Instead
of removing him, last autumn, when the row was
on, our press campaign against him caused his superiors
to bide their time, but it must be a great trial to Sir L.
to be removed at so critical a moment to another post
which, though bigger and better paid, is not of the
imminent importance of this.</p>


<h3><em>April 22d.</em></h3>

<p>The wedding morn of thirteen years ago! And we
are in Mexico, in full intervention! The troops can’t
get up from Vera Cruz by rail, as the Mexicans got
away with all the locomotives when the town was taken.
That beautiful plan of Butler’s ... I understand that
he is in Tampico, with his marines, and the other marines
are only due to-day in Vera Cruz. It will take
three weeks, even without resistance, for them to march
up with their heavy equipment.</p>

<p>At 12.30 last night N., who had gone to bed and to
sleep, after a more than strenuous day, was called to the
telephone by the excited consul-general, who had had
the United States shield torn off the Consulate, and other
indignities offered the sacred building, including window-breaking
by the mob. N. wonders if Huerta will try to
keep him here as a hostage. Huerta told N. that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
intends to take our arms away, and, of course, there is
no way of keeping them if he decides to do so. We have
certainly trampled on the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo
after 1848, providing that all disputes should be submitted
first for arbitration. So sing me no songs of
treaty rights!</p>

<p>We heard last night that the Zapatistas were to unite
with Huerta. It would be interesting and curious to see
a “Mexico united” on any point. If those bandits come
out of their <i lang="es">barrancas</i> and mountains and do to the
Americans half the evil they work on one another, there
will be many a desolate mother, wife, sister, and sweetheart
north of the Rio Grande. N. says we may get off
to-morrow morning. No night trips. Yesterday Carden
and von Hintze tried to get Huerta to arrange for the
despatching of a refugee train to leave not later than
seven this morning, but why he should do that, or
anything for any one, unless it falls in with his own
plans, I don’t see. It is curious that the Americans did
not get hold of a few locomotives. The railroad is indeed
sounding brass and tinkling cymbals without them.</p>

<p>Every arm-chair, sofa, and bed in the house was
occupied last night, and many of the inmates lay on the
floor. Constantly, in the distance, sounds the beautiful
Mexican bugle-call. The brass summons is clear and
noble, and the drums beat to the nation’s pulse—a poor
thing, according to us, but Mexico’s own. Where will
it all end? With the taking of Vera Cruz, through whose
customs a full fourth of the total imports come, Huerta
is out a million pesos a month, more or less. We are
certainly isolating and weakening him at a great rate.
“Might is right.” We can begin to teach it in the schools.</p>

<p>We have heard nothing from Washington, and nothing
from Vera Cruz. Alone on our plateau! Up to now,
there are no great anti-American demonstrations. I put<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
my faith in Huerta, in spite of the feeling which Burnside
expressed, that he might show Nelson an Indian’s treachery.
Aunt Laura is game. It is good fortune for her to
have that comfortable home just across the way to go to.</p>

<p>Something is being prepared in town. To-morrow we
may get away. N. begins to feel that he ought to be out
of here, the Mexican <i lang="fr">chargé</i> at Washington having left
yesterday, with the entire Embassy staff. This we learn
from the Foreign Office here, <em>not</em> from Washington.</p>

<p>The newspapers are rather fierce this morning. One
head-line in the <cite>Independiente</cite> is to the effect that “the
Federal bullets will no longer spill brothers’ blood, but
will perforate blond heads and white breasts swollen
with vanity and cowardice.” “Like a horde of bandits
the invaders assaulted the three-times heroic Vera Cruz.
The brave <i lang="es">costeños</i> made the foreign thieves bite the
dust they had stained with their impure blood,” etc.
The newspapers add that the Americans landed “without
a declaration of war, feloniously and advantageously.”
“Anathema to the cowardly mercantile projects
of the President of the United States!” they shriek.
They had a picture of Mr. Wilson sitting on heaped-up
money-bags, Huerta standing before him, a basket of
eggs on each arm. “The true forces of the opponents,”
this was labeled. It is impossible to expect the Mexicans
to seize the idea that the landing of our troops was a
simple police measure. In face of the facts, such subtle
distinctions will, I am sure, be overlooked. “<i lang="es">El suelo
de la patria está conculcado por el invasor extranjero</i>,” is
the <em>fact</em> to them! I inclose here what the papers call “<i lang="es">el
manifiesto laconico y elocuente del Señor Presidente de la
Republica</i>.”</p>

<h3><em>12.30.</em></h3>

<p>N. has just come in to say that perhaps we leave to-morrow
for Guadalajara and Manzanillo. I am not
crazy to see the Pacific coast under these conditions.
How many uncertain hours, wild mountains, and deep
<i lang="es">barrancas</i> are between us and the United States men-of-war.</p>

<p>Mr. Cummings, chief of the cable-office, and all
his men were dismissed this morning, to be replaced by
Federals. A dramatic incident occurred when he went
into the office to collect his money and private papers.
Finding himself for a moment alone, he quickly went to
the telegraph key and called up Vera Cruz. The operator
there answered, “They are fighting at the roundhouse.”
There was a snap, and he heard no more.
Some one was listening and shut him off. That is the
only authentic news we have heard from Vera Cruz, or
anywhere, for two days. But the wild rumors around
town are numberless and disquieting. Nothing is
touched down-stairs. I don’t want to alarm people needlessly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
by stripping my rooms; and who knows if we can
take out, if and when we go, more than the strict necessities.
There will always be a fair amount of Embassy
papers, codes, etc., that must go, whatever else is left.</p>


<h3><em>10.30</em> <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span></h3>

<p>At five o’clock I went down-stairs to my drawing-room—the
matchless Mexican sun streaming in at the
windows—and poured tea. It was the last time, though
I didn’t know it. Many people came in: Kanya, Stalewski,
von Papen, Marie Simon, Cambiaggio, Rowan,
de Soto, and others; de Bertier had gone to Tampico.
No one knew what was to happen to us. Had we received
our passports? Were we to stay on? Could negotiations
be reopened? Each came with another rumor,
another question. The Cardens came in late, Sir
Lionel very agitated over the rumors of the Zapatistas
coming to town to-night. They are supposed to have
joined with the Federals. It was the first time I have
seen Sir L. since his return. He seemed whiter, paler,
and older than when he went away. Then von Hintze
came. We talked of the hazy Vera Cruz incident and
its international bearing, <em>if</em> the captain of the <em>Ypiranga</em>
had been stopped on the high seas, before the blockading
of the port, etc.</p>

<p>There was a gleam in von Hintze’s eye during the
conversation, answered by one in mine. We were both
thinking that history has a way of repeating itself. He
was von Dietrich’s flag-lieutenant at Manila, Rowan’s
position with Fletcher at Vera Cruz. It was he who
took the famous message to Dewey and received the
equally famous and emphatic answer—so emphatic, history
has it, that he almost backed down the hatchway
in his surprise. Thirteen years afterward he finds himself
in an American Embassy, discussing another marine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
incident concerning Germany and the United States, another
flag-lieutenant sitting by!<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>During all this time, the Embassy was closely surrounded
by troops. Hearing more than the usual noise,
I asked Rowan to see what was going on. It proved to
be a large squad of soldiers come to take our arms and
ammunition away—our sacred doves of peace. All was
done with the greatest politeness—but it was done!
Two hundred and fifty rifles, two machine-guns, seventy-six
thousand of one kind of ammunition, nine thousand
of another. It was a tea-party, indeed. At half after
seven an officer appeared in the drawing-room, as von
Hintze and I were sitting there alone, saying that the
President was outside. Von Hintze departed through
the dining-room, after hastily helping me and McKenna
to remove the tea-table. There was no time to ring for
servants. I went to the door and waited on the honeysuckle
and geranium-scented veranda while the tearless
old Indian, not in his top-hat (“<i lang="es">que da mas dignidad</i>”),
but in his gray sweater and soft hat, more suitable to
events, came quickly up the steps. It was his first and
last visit to the Embassy during our incumbency.</p>

<p>I led him into the drawing-room, where, to the accompaniment
of stamping hoofs outside, of changing arms,
and footsteps coming and going, we had a strange and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
moving conversation. I could not, for my country’s
sake, speak the endless regret that was in my heart
for the official part we had been obliged to play in the
hateful drama enacted by us to his country’s undoing.
He greeted me calmly.</p>

<p>“Señora, how do you do? I fear you have had many
annoyances.”</p>

<p>Then he sat back, quietly, in a big arm-chair, impersonal
and inscrutable. I answered as easily as I could
that the times were difficult for all, but that we were
most appreciative of what he had done for our personal
safety and that of our nationals, and asked him if there
was nothing we could do for him. He gave me a long,
intraverted, and at the same time piercing look, and,
after a pause, answered:</p>

<p>“Nothing, señora. All that is done I must do myself.
Here I remain. The moment has not come for me to go.
Nothing but death could remove me now.”</p>

<p>I felt the tears come hot to my eyes, as I answered—taking
refuge in generalities in that difficult moment—“Death
is not so terrible a thing.”</p>

<p>He answered again, very quietly, “It is the natural
law, to which we must all submit. We were born into the
world according to the natural law, and must depart
according to it—that is all.”</p>

<p>He has wavy, interlacing, but not disturbing gestures
as he speaks. He went on to say that he had come, in
his name and that of his señora, to ask N. and myself to
attend the wedding of his son, Victor, the next day. And
notwithstanding much advice to the contrary by timid
ones, we think it expedient to go. The safety of all
hangs on his good-will, and it will be wise, as well as
decent, to offer him this last public attention. Just
then Nelson came in. After greeting the President, he
said, rather hastily, “They have taken the arms away.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span></p>

<p>Huerta answered with a gesture of indifference, “It
must be,” adding, “<i lang="es">no le hace</i>” (“it doesn’t matter”).</p>

<p>I told him with a smile, which he quite understood,
that it wasn’t much in the way of an exchange. (As we
had taken seventeen million rounds of ammunition, and
God knows how many guns and rifles in Vera Cruz, his
haul at the Embassy did seem rather small!) He does
not want us to go out by Guadalajara and Manzanillo,
and, unless compelled to cut the line, he gives us his
train to-morrow night to Vera Cruz, with a full escort,
including three officers of high rank.</p>

<p>“I would go myself,” he said, “but I cannot leave.
I hope to send my son in my place, if he returns from the
north, as I expect.”</p>

<p>I was dreadfully keyed up, as you can imagine; I felt
the tears gush to my eyes. He seemed to think it was
fear that moved me, for he told me not to be anxious.</p>

<p>I said, “I am not weeping for myself, but for the
tragedy of life.”</p>

<p>And, indeed, since seeing him I have been in a sea of
sadness, personal and impersonal—impersonal because
of the crushing destiny that can overtake a strong man
and a country, and personal, because this many-colored,
vibrant Mexican experience of mine is drawing to a
close. Nothing can ever resemble it.</p>

<p>As we three stood there together he uttered, very
quietly, his last word:</p>

<p>“I hold no rancor toward the American people, nor
toward <i lang="es">su Excelencia el Señor Presidente Wilson</i>.” And,
after a slight pause, he added, “<em>He has not understood.</em>”</p>

<p>It was the first and last time I ever heard him speak
the President’s name. I gave him my hand as he stood
with his other hand on Nelson’s shoulder, and knew that
this was indeed the end. I think he realized that my
heart was warm and my sympathies outrushing to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
beautiful, agonizing Mexico; for, as he stood at the door,
he suddenly turned and made me a deep reverence.
Then, taking N.’s arm, he went out into the starry, perfumed
evening, and I turned back into the dwelling I
was so soon to leave, with the sadness of life, like a hot
point, deep in my heart. So is history written. So do
circumstances and a man’s will seem to raise him up to
great ends, and so does destiny crush him.... And
we, who arrogated to ourselves vengeance for unproven
deeds in a foreign land, was vengeance ours?</p>

<p>I left the Embassy staff alone at dinner and came
up-stairs, to Aunt Laura. Again I was sick at the
thought of leaving her, old, ill, and in troubles of many
kinds. I will do what I can for her before I go; but oh,
I am sad, very sad, to-night. Whatever else life may
have in reserve for me, this last conversation with a strong
man of another psychology than mine will remain engraven
on my heart—his calm, his philosophy on the
eve of a war he knows can only end in disaster for himself
and his people. His many faults, his crimes, even,
his desperate expedients to sustain himself, his non-fulfilments—all
vanish. I know his spirit possesses
something which will see him safely over the dark spaces
and hours when they come.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<h3><em>April 24th. 9</em> <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>
(In the train, after our sudden departure last night.)</h3>

<p class="dropcap">We have just passed the famous Metlac Bridge.
Far down these enchanting curves I see the military
train which precedes us, with troops to test the line,
and a flatcar for our three automobiles, to get us
through the Federal lines at Tejería. We passed slowly
over the Metlac Bridge. There, in the middle, was
flying the great, white flag of peace! We could proceed.
It made our hearts beat fast. The splendors of this
land under this cloudless sky are indescribable; marvelous
odors come in at the windows, and great, blazing
stars of red and vermilion decorate every bush. The
broad banana leaves take every possible glint, and the
bayonet palms are swords of light. Everything is gorgeous—everything
a splendid blaze.</p>

<p>At Orizaba orderly crowds cried “<i lang="es">Viva Mexico!</i>”
“<i lang="es">Mueran los Gringos!</i>” and bared their heads, as the
troop-cars attached to our train rolled out. I cannot
keep my eyes from the beauties of this natural world
through which we are journeying, conducted so royally
by command of the “Grand Old Indian.” Nature is so
generous here that she neither needs nor asks the co-operation
of man in her giving. Alas for him!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span></p>

<p>At six o’clock this morning they awakened us at
Esperanza, the highest point, to get out for a good breakfast
offered by Corona. The troops accompanying us
were also fed, which does not always happen. Rowan
jogged the general’s mind by offering them a breakfast
from <em>us</em>, but he said, “Oh no; we will provide for
them.” He evidently had orders from “on high” to
spare no trouble or expense.</p>


<h3><em>10.45.</em></h3>

<p>We have just passed Cordoba, finding the crowds distinctly
more uneasy. We bought piles of bananas and
oranges that Rowan is taking into the troop-car. He
has just come back to say the soldiers are all smiles.
The difficulty with the army is that the officers never in
any way look after their men—and a soldier with an
empty stomach and sore feet is a sad proposition.
It is getting very warm. We are in the heart of the
coffee zone and have only about eighteen hundred feet to
travel before reaching sea-level. Embosomed in trees
or pressed against blue-green hills are the pink belfries
and domes my heart knows so well and my eyes love, a
Spanish heritage of the land. I was thankful to see,
higher up, that barley and corn were being planted for
the hungry days to come. Morning-glories twist about
every stump and branch and the hibiscus has a richer
color. Beautiful, beautiful Mexico!...</p>

<p>I wonder if the Embassy was pillaged and burned last
night? Oh, the <em>waste</em> there! No time to sort out things.
My clothes still hanging in the closets, my bric-à-brac
left about, and I dare say a lot of trash was packed that
I don’t care for. Dear Mrs. Melick kissed me as I came
out on General Corona’s arm, in a dream, it seemed to
me, Elim clinging to my hand, to take the auto for the
station. I had left Aunt Laura in the <i lang="fr">salon</i> with various
friends whose faces are one great blur in my memory, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
Mrs. Melick was going in to get her and take her to her
house. Since yesterday afternoon Americans can no
longer leave Mexico City. Huerta, having heard that no
Mexicans could leave Vera Cruz, posted this order. My
heart is sad at leaving our people. Heaven knows what
will happen to them. The Mexicans have commandeered
all arms except those of foreign legations (and <em>they</em> will
probably have to go), all horses, all automobiles, great
reserves of gasoline, etc. The Embassy was well provisioned.</p>

<p>Last night our train was supposed to go at nine o’clock,
but we did not leave until eleven-thirty. The <i lang="fr">chers collègues</i>
and a very few others who knew of our going were
there to see us off, in the dimly lighted, gray station.
At ten I begged our friends to go, and said good-by
to von Hintze, Hohler, von Papen, les Ayguesparsse,
Stalewski, Letellier, Kanya, and the Simons. (Simon
has forty-five millions in <em>gold</em> in the Banco Nacional;
some day he must give it up at the point of the pistol.)
We have masses of letters and telegrams to deliver. The
“Pius Fund” (forty-three thousand dollars) and my
jewels and money of our own and other people’s I carried
in the black hand-bag with the gilt clasps which you
gave me in Paris. McKenna guards the codes as if they
were infants. No sovereign of Europe could have
planned and executed this departure of ours more royally
than Huerta did it. You remember Polo de Bernabé’s
account of his “escape” from the land of the
Stars and Stripes?</p>

<p>At Guadalupe, the first stop just outside the city, a
painful incident occurred. About twenty-five persons,
<em>friends</em>, were waiting there to board the train and continue
the journey with us. But N. had given his word
of honor, when he received the safe-conduct, that no
person or persons other than the personnel of Embassy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
and Consulate should avail themselves of this privilege.
So rarely was faith kept with Huerta that it seemed hard
that it should be done in this crucial hour and at the
expense of our own people. We intended, however, to
save even honor; but as our train rolled out of the station
I felt, to the full, “the fell clutch of circumstance.”</p>

<p>My idea is to be immediately vaccinated and injected
for all ills, and to return from New York with the first
Red Cross brigade. I look into the deep <i lang="es">barrancas</i> and
up the high mountains, and know <em>my</em> people will be lying
there, needing help, before long. Zapata is supposed to
have offered his services to Huerta, to place himself in
the Sierras between Puebla and the Tierra Caliente.
He can do heartbreaking things. I know I must go now,
but afterward I can return to work. Shall we ever again
have an embassy in Mexico? This seems the death of
Mexican sovereignty, <i lang="fr">la fin d’une nation</i>.</p>

<p>I saw Sir Lionel for a moment, alone, last night.
I thanked him for all the work, the great responsibility
that he was about to undertake for our people. He is
very worried and anxious, and kept saying, “Oh, the
dreadful responsibility it will be!” I told him we would
not fail to let Washington know all that he would be
doing for us. I fear a nervous break for him. Tears were
in his eyes and his lip trembled. Our press has not
handled him gently these past months. I felt both grateful
and ashamed.</p>

<p>We have just passed over a deep, vine-draped ravine—the
Atoyac Gorge, with a noisy river flowing through.
Women and children are bathing and washing clothes
under the trees. Occasionally a blonde baby is seen in
his dark mother’s arms—so is life perpetuated. We
have just passed the village of Atoyac, with its little
thatched shacks and adobe huts, where the people are
shouting “<i lang="es">Viva Mexico!</i>” and we are about to make our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
last descent into the burning plain. There, after a while,
our outposts will be waiting for us—<em>our</em> people waiting
to receive their own. This is the march of empire in
which we literally join. <em>Southward</em> she takes her course.
General Corona has had many offerings of fruit and
flowers, people whom he had never seen calling him “<i lang="es">Ramoncito</i>”
and “<i lang="es">Mi General</i>,” and throwing pineapples
and oranges into the train—the offerings of humble
hearts.</p>

<p>But I must go back to Wednesday night—our last
night in Mexico City—when I was too tired for feeling
or thought. In the morning Nelson decided that, under
the circumstances, he would not, <em>could</em> not, go to the
Huerta wedding. Then I decided to go alone. Rowan
went with me, in the automobile. I put on my best
black things, long white gloves, and pearls, got through
the crowd in front of the Embassy, and went to the
President’s house in the Calle Alfonso Herrera, enfolded
and exhilarated by dazzling air. I got there to find
myself the only foreigner, of course, and only three or
four other women, the wives of Cabinet Ministers and
generals. The men were mostly in full uniform. Madame
Huerta came in, looking very handsome and dignified
in a becoming dress of delicate pomegranate color
veiled partly with black lace—a <em>good</em> dress. We gave
each other the <i lang="es">abrazo</i>, and she placed me at her side, on the
sofa. The youngest son, Roberto, a fat but <i lang="es">sympatico</i>
boy of fourteen, also in full uniform, came in and kissed his
<i lang="es">mamacita’s</i> hand, and asked for some order. The dark,
bright-eyed bride, in a dress with a good deal of imitation
lace, arrived nearly three-quarters of an hour late.
Immediately after her arrival the President entered, in
his slouch-hat and the celebrated gray sweater.</p>

<p>He quickly greeted the guests, called his wife, “Emilia,”
and then turned to me. “Mrs. O’Shaughnessy,” he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
said, and indicated a place near the table where the
marriage contract was to be signed. So I rose, and
stood with the family during the ceremony, which he
had put through at a lively pace. The contract, in
referring to the parents of the bridegroom, said “Victoriano
Huerta, fifty-nine,” and “Emilia Huerta, fifty-two.”
His age may be lessened in this document a
year or two, but I doubt it. Madame Huerta can’t be
much more than fifty-two. The youngest girl, Valencita,
is only seven.</p>

<p>After the ceremony, when we all went out to get into
the automobiles, Señora Blanquet was with us. She is
short, stout, and elderly. I wanted to give her her place
as wife of the Minister of War, but the President, who
helped me in, insisted first upon giving me his wife’s
place. I said, firmly, “No”; but I was obliged to take
the seat beside her, while Señora Blanquet struggled
with the narrow <i lang="es">strapontin</i>! Imagine my feelings as we
started off through the dazzling streets to the somewhat
distant “Buen Tono” church—built by Pugibet, of
“Buen Tono” cigarette fame, and put by him, most
beautifully decorated, at the disposition of the President
for the wedding. On our arrival the President, who
had gone ahead, appeared to help us out of the motor;
then, saying to me, “<i lang="es">Tengo que hacer</i>” (“I have
something to do”), he disappeared. I never saw him
again.</p>

<p>I went up the aisle after Madame Huerta, on Rincon
Gaillardo’s arm. As soon as we were in our seats the
archbishop came out and the ceremony began—dignified
and beautiful. Afterward there was a low Mass with
fine music. The tears kept welling up in my eyes as I
knelt before the altar of the God of us all. After the
ceremony was over we went out into the sacristy. I
congratulated the bride and groom, spoke to a few of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
the colleagues who were near, and then, feeling that
my day and hour were over, I went up to Madame
Huerta.</p>

<p>We embraced several times, with tears in our eyes,
each of us knowing it was the end and thinking of the
horrors to come. Then I left the sacristy on some officer’s
arm—I don’t know who it was—and was put into
my motor, where Rowan was patiently waiting. There
were huge crowds before the church, but never a murmur
against us. Tears were raining down my cheeks,
but Rowan said: “Don’t mind. The Mexicans will
understand the tribute, and all your sadness and
regret.”</p>

<p>We passed by the round point, the “Glorieta,” where
I had seen the statue of George Washington so solemnly
unveiled two years ago, on the 22d of February, 1912.
It had been pulled down in the night. On the defaced
pedestal had been placed a small bust of Hidalgo.
Flowers were scattered about, and a Mexican flag covered
the inscription on the marble base. I learned afterward
that the statue had been dragged in the night by
powerful automobiles, and placed at the feet of the
statue of Benito Juarez, in the Avenida Juarez, whence
the authorities had had the courtesy, and had taken the
time, to withdraw it—through streets whose windows
were hung with flags of every nationality except ours:
German, French, English, Spanish.</p>

<p>At 12.50 I got home to find still larger crowds of
Americans at the Embassy—orderly and polite, but deep
anxiety was on every face; all realized the issue before
them. At three o’clock I heard that we would be leaving
about seven. So many people were coming in that I had
no time to separate my things from the Embassy things,
nor even to make any selections. Berthe was occupied
in throwing various articles into open trunks and valises,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
some of value, some without. I don’t think <em>she</em> lost a
pin. I didn’t get even to my big writing-desk, where I
had sat for seven months. You can imagine all the things
that were left there, the accumulations of these historic
months. All my bibelots were left about the <i lang="fr">salon</i>,
the <i lang="es">mantas</i> and <i lang="es">serapes</i>, the signed photographs that have
accompanied me for years, my beautiful old frames. But
in the face of the national catastrophe, and the leaving
of our people to God knows what, I seemed to lose all
sense of personal possession or to feel that objects could
have a value.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>We have just passed Paso del Macho. Many people,
motley groups, were standing near the train, crying
“<i lang="es">Viva la Independencia de Mexico!</i>” Rowan says <em>he</em> wants
to hear more “<i lang="es">Mueran los Gringos!</i>” We are about
forty-five kilometers from Vera Cruz, and the heat,
after the plateau, seems intense; though it is not disagreeable
to feel the dissolving <i lang="fr">détente</i> of the skin and
nerves after the dry tenseness of many months at eight
thousand feet.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Soledad</span>, <em>1.15.</em></h3>

<p>A blaze of heat, merciless, white. We find Mexican
rifles stacked at intervals along the station platforms,
and there are groups of young <i lang="es">voluntarios</i> looking proudly
at their first guns or drawing long, cruel knives from
their belts. Some are eating small, green limes, not
nourishing at best, slashing at them with their <i lang="es">machetes</i>.
The lack of a commissariat is what prevents the Mexican
army from being in any way efficient. (Think of the full
stomachs and comfortably shod feet of our men.) Flatcars
with cannon and automobiles are on the sidings.
General Gustavo Maass, whom I have not seen since
our trip to Vera Cruz in January, is here in command.
He will not prove efficient—a blue-eyed Mexican,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
wearing his sandy-gray hair in a German brush effect,
<em>can’t</em> be.</p>


<h3><em>4 o’clock.</em></h3>

<p>We have passed Tejería, the last Mexican station; the
sand-hills and spires of Vera Cruz will soon be distinguishable.
I have just looked out the window, my eyes
dim with tears. Far up the broken track the blessed
white flag of truce can be seen approaching—our people,
our men, coming for their own. Admiral Fletcher evidently
got the telegram. Am writing these words on
the bottom of a little bonbon-box, which afterward I
will tuck into my hand-bag. Oh, the burning dreariness
of this land! The hot, dry inhospitality of it! The Mexican
officers of our escort are passing and repassing my
door, with troubled, anxious, hot faces. It is a bitter
pill, but I see no use in trying to sugar-coat it by conversation.
They know my heart is heavy, too.</p>


<h3><em>Later, on the margin of a page of the “Mexican Herald.”</em></h3>

<p>Nelson has gone with the Mexican officers up the
track to meet our men, and all are getting out of the
train, standing in the rank, stiff grass by the track.
God made the heaven and the earth....</p>


<h3><em>Vera Cruz, April 25th. Morning.</em></h3>

<p>On board the <em>Minnesota</em>, in the very comfortable
quarters of the admiral. We were awakened by the
band playing the “Star-spangled Banner,” “God Save
the King,” the beautiful Spanish national air, the
“Marseillaise”—all according to the order of the arrival
of the ships in the harbor. A delightful breeze is blowing
and the electric fans are at work.</p>

<p>The last word I scribbled yesterday afternoon was
when I was waiting in my state-room for Nelson to come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
back to our Mexican train, with our officers, under the
white flag. I was delighted and deeply moved when
suddenly big, agreeable, competent Captain Huse appeared
at the door and said, “Mrs. O’Shaughnessy, I
am glad to see you safely arrived and to welcome you to
our lines.”</p>

<p>Poor General Corona stood by at the meeting, and I
turned to him with a more than hearty handshake. He
kissed my hand, and his eyes filled. Poor, poor people!
As Captain Huse helped me out of the train, to my joy
and surprise I saw Hohler standing by the track. He
had taken down a trainful of agitated Germans, English,
and Americans, two days before, and was to go back to
Mexico City with our returning train and escort. I had
a few words with him, amid the dry cactus of the parched
field, and commended to his courage and good sense our
poor, distracted compatriots left in the volcanic city.
There may be no concerted massacre of Americans, but
the day will come when there will be other horrors.
Hohler said he had not slept for three nights, and only
prayed for a couple of hours of oblivion before tackling
anything else. I wished him Godspeed, and gave him a
handclasp to match the temperature.</p>

<p>Then Captain Huse came up to me, saying: “We must
go. Time is passing, and we are unarmed.”</p>

<p>As I turned to walk down the track with him I saw the
pathetic spectacle of Madame Maass, whom I had parted
from on that starry night of the Fletcher dinner, four
months or more ago. She had walked, bareheaded, up
that dusty stretch of track, from one train to the other,
to go to join her husband at Soledad. The step on to
the train by the steep embankment was so high I could
not get up, nor could she descend; so she leaned down to
me and I reached up to her. Tears were streaming down
her grimy face; her black skirt was torn and rusty, her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
other clothing nondescript, to say the least; a pathetic,
stout, elderly woman caught out in the troubles
of war—or of peace, as they tell me it is called in
Washington.</p>

<p>Then Captain Huse and two of his officers, Lieutenant
Fletcher, nephew of Admiral Fletcher, and Ensign Dodd,
walked down the track with me about two kilometers.
The rails were torn up, but the road-bed was undestroyed,
and as we walked along in the blazing sun, with scrubby,
dusty palms and cactus in the grayish fields on either
side, my back turned to the Mexican train, I was divided
between joy and sorrow—joy to see and be with my own
again and the haunting thought of poor, distracted
Mexico, and of our own people, whom we had been
obliged to leave to Heaven knows what fate. It is
easy to be the last out of the danger zone, but very, very
hard to be the first; I hope that another time, if fate
puts us again in such strange places, we will be the last
to go.</p>

<p>We finally got to our own train, which was run by a
poor, dilapidated, leaking, propped-up engine, all that
was left. The Mexicans had been quick about the machines,
and every locomotive had been seized by them
and sent away, after which they had destroyed those
kilometers of track. Everybody climbed into the relief-train,
and there came the question of getting our luggage
from one train to another. Captain Huse had been
obliged to come without an escort, accompanied only by
Fletcher and Dodd, unarmed. Until they had us they
could not make terms. So, to make a very long story
short, several cutthroat-looking peons, casting deadly
glances at <i lang="es">los Gringos</i>, transferred a lot of the hand-luggage,
aided by the men of the party. All I possess of
value, except that left at the Embassy, is contained in a
single, large trunk, now reposing in the cactus-fields in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
the enemy’s lines, watched over by the same shambling,
dark-browed, cutthroat Mexicans who helped to transfer
the small baggage.</p>

<p>Captain Huse, finding himself with a broken-down engine
and a lot of unarmed civilians, and with sundown
approaching, was too anxious to get into his own lines to
think of such trifles. He said, afterward, “You didn’t
realize what danger we were in.” I remember that I
saw his face suddenly light up, as we slowly moved along.
He had caught sight of the outposts that Admiral
Fletcher, with vigilant forethought, had placed five miles
out of town, with guns and telescopes, ready to rush to
our aid, if necessary. Then he knew all was well, and, in
spite of the fact that I had not been able to realize any
danger, my eyes filled again at the sight of our brave men,
some looking through their telescopes, others ready with
their guns.</p>

<p>I asked Captain Huse, “Are we at war with Mexico?”</p>

<p>And he answered, “I don’t know.” Adding, “They
say not; but when one armed force opposes another
armed force, and many are killed, we are rather of the
opinion that it is war.”</p>

<p>He had just come from the thick of the fray. <em>We</em> had
sixty-three wounded, seventeen killed, and several hundred
Mexicans were killed and wounded. The Cadet
Academy made a fine defense. There would have been
more casualties for us, but at the critical moment the
<em>San Francisco</em>, the <em>Chester</em>, and the <em>Prairie</em> opened fire
on the Academy, a few feet only above the heads of their
own men, neatly piercing the windows of the broad, low
façade, as they would bulls’-eyes. All the officers are
agreed that the immense sums spent in target practice
by the navy in the past five years were amply compensated
by that moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span></p>

<p>As we neared Vera Cruz our men in khaki (or white
clothes dyed in coffee, according to the hurry order) were
seen in big detachments in classic poses—standing, leaning
on their guns, or sitting in groups on the ground,
drinking coffee and smoking. I must say it looked very
cozy and safe. Admiral Fletcher met us at the station,
and I was glad indeed to clasp that brave, friendly hand
again. He has done splendid work along all lines, passive
or active, ever since he came to Mexican waters. Shortly
afterward I said good-by to him and to Captain Huse,
who is his chief of staff, and we went out in the admiral’s
barge over the glistening harbor, a thousand lights still
lighting it, as when I last saw it, but all else changed.
Captain Simpson, of the <em>Minnesota</em>, is on land duty, but
the second in command, Commander Moody, met us at
the gangway and we were shown into these most comfortable
quarters. I have heard so much of the discomfort
and heat of the men-of-war that I am most agreeably
surprised. The electric fan is working ten thousand
revolutions a moment; some one has called the new
fan <i lang="es">la Mexicana</i>, for obvious reasons. Admiral Badger
came to welcome us last night, a great, powerful, steam-engine
of a man—a “dictator” (pardon the awful word)!
It is a big thing to have complete charge of so powerful
a combination as the North Atlantic fleet. He also said
he didn’t know whether we were at war or not,
but that armed, opposing forces with heavy casualties
on both sides was generally considered to be
war; that we now “enjoyed all the <em>dis</em>advantages
of both peace and war.” He had heard we were
arriving with eight hundred refugees, and had chartered
the <em>Mexico</em>, of the Ward Line, to take them away.</p>

<p>He asked, “Where are all the others?”</p>

<p>We said, “We are all that were allowed to come.”
Apropos of that, if it isn’t war, it is, as some one remarked,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
“sufficiently Shermanically synonymous” for
those left in the interior!</p>


<h3><em>11 o’clock.</em></h3>

<p>Captain O’Keefe, of the <em>Mexico</em>, came to my state-room
a while ago. I had not seen him since before the “peace
at any price” régime was inaugurated. He is waiting
for a full complement of refugees; they are expecting a
boatful from Coatzacoalcos, this afternoon. Am sitting
in the drawing-room of the admiral, cannon trained from
the windows. The <em>Condé</em> got in early this morning.
Lying in my berth I could see her manœuvering into hers.
It is intensely hot in the harbor. Two hours ago Nelson
went to the Consulate with his clerks. There is a mass of
work to be done, besides negotiations for getting all
Americans out of Mexico City. I wonder if that big,
pleasant Embassy is now a mass of charred ruins?
A heavenly breeze is blowing through the room as I
write. I would be very interested in what is going on
about us were it not for the preoccupation about those
left behind. Elim has a toy pistol which he has been
showing to the blue-jackets. He says it is strange how
frightened they all are, and told me, with shining eyes,
he already had four friends on the ship and would soon
have six. It is a blessed age—where one can so definitely
count one’s friends.</p>


<h3><em>4</em> <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span></h3>

<p>I have been sitting on deck, watching this busy port.
Innumerable small boats, flying our flag are rapidly
passing to and fro over the burning waters. Behind the
<em>Condé</em>, which has effectually blocked the view of the
outer harbor, is the <em>Solace</em>. She contains the wounded,
the dead, and, mayhap, the dying ones. The <em>Minnesota</em>
is so near the Sanidad pier that one can almost recognize
individuals. Squads of our men are constantly marching
along with prisoners between double files, men who have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
been caught sniping, bearing arms, or doing some overt
act or deed of violence. Last night, while dining, the
echo of shots came from the shore, and during the night,
from time to time, desultory ghostly sounds of sniping
were heard.</p>

<p>I have just looked through the glass to distinguish
about a dozen of our men standing at the head of a street
with fixed bayonets, facing a pink house, evidently ready
to protect some one coming out of it, or to do justice.
The lone torpedo-tube from San Juan Ulua is trained
toward the <em>Minnesota</em>, but it is believed to be inoffensive.
I am sure I hope it is, cuddled under our bows, so to
speak. Yesterday two Mexican officers came out of that
historic fortress, begging to be allowed to get food.
They said they and all the inmates were starving. I
saw the conditions in days of relative plenty. What
must they be <em>now</em> in those damp, deep, vermin-infested
holes? Pale specters of men, too weak to move, or wild
with hunger and all the ensuing horrors—and all this so
near that I could almost hit it with a stone.</p>

<p>Ships of refugees are passing in and out. A Dutch
ship, <em>Andrijk</em>, has just left, and a French one, the <em>Texas</em>,
passed by us, leaving for Tampico to gather up refugees.
Think of all the comfortable homes, with the precious
accumulations of lifetimes of thrift and work, that are
deserted in the disorder of flight, to be left later to the
complete devastation of looters. All over the country
this is taking place. An officer who saw a group of thirty
or forty refugees at Tampico told me he thought at first
it was a band of gypsies; it proved, however, to be half-clad,
starving women and children who but a few days
before had been prosperous American citizens.</p>

<p>The sun is under a cloud, but a hot, damp atmosphere
has enveloped the port, and an opalescent light
plays over the town. From where I sit I can see the old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
white fortress of Sant’ Iago which we shelled, and the
yellow Naval Academy where the Mexican youths made
their gallant stand. The chartered boats of the Ward
Line, <em>Mexico</em>, <em>Monterey</em>, and <em>Esperanza</em>, also the now
historic <em>Ypiranga</em>, are lying close to the various piers,
ready to receive refugees and take them to New Orleans
or Galveston. There they will be, in many cases, a three
days’ source of interest—and then they can starve!</p>

<p>Helen, the deer, a great pet of the sailors, and got in
Tampico, keeps trying to nibble my long, white veil; the
spotless decks are rather poor for browsing, and she looks
a bit disconsolate at times. A snappy green parrot is
being taught to say, “Look out for the snipers.”</p>


<h3><em>April 25th. 10.30.</em></h3>

<p>I spent yesterday quietly on board, getting my breath.
N. was at the Consulate all day, where he had been sending
off his mail. About five o’clock, when he went to
return Admiral Badger’s call, I went into town, first to
the headquarters of Admiral Fletcher, at the fly-infested
Hotel Terminal. In the past the proprietor has encouraged
in many ingenious ways the propagation of the fly.
He owns the other hotel, the Diligencias, where he has
his cuisine. In order to save himself the expense and
bother of keeping two cooking-places going, he allowed
the Terminal to become so disgustingly infested with
flies that the “guests” are obliged to tramp through the
hot streets to the Diligencias whenever the pangs of
hunger or thirst assail them. We have cleaned out more
things than flies in the tropics, however.</p>

<p>I saw at the headquarters, for a moment, Captain
Huse, Sir Christopher, and <i lang="fr">le capitaine de vaisseau</i>
Graux, commanding the <em>Condé</em>, and many others. Afterward
Admiral Fletcher sent Rowan with me to see the
town.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span></p>

<p>Everything is closely watched and controlled by our five
thousand or more blue-jackets and marines. Everywhere
are the marks of bullets along the once-peaceful streets—the
clean perforations of the steel-jacketed bullets of the
American rifles; quaint cornices chipped; electric street
globes destroyed; pink façades looking as if there was
a design in white where the shots had taken off the color.
We walked over to the Plaza, meeting acquaintances at
every step, harassed and discomfited refugees. Several
hundreds had just got into the city of the “Truly” Cross
from Mexico City in the last train, having been nearly
twenty hours <i lang="fr">en route</i> and having left most of what they
possessed for the mobs of Mexico City. It is difficult to
get any exact information from them. According to
their stories, many of the bankers were in jail; American
shops were looted; some Americans were killed; and all
Mexican servants had been warned to leave American
homes. As they left only seven hours later than we did,
I don’t know that their information is worth much.
The telegraph lines are down. What we do know is that
dreadful things can happen in that beautiful city at any
moment. When the Embassy was closed, the whole
thing collapsed, from the point of view of Americans.</p>

<p>When Rowan and I got to the Plaza we found the
band of the <em>Florida</em> playing in the band-stand—nothing
like so well as the Mexican Policia Band, by the way—and
hundreds of people, foreigners, Americans, Mexicans,
sitting about, taking their lukewarm drinks under the
<i lang="es">portales</i> of the Hotel Diligencias, whose ice-plant had
been destroyed by a shell from the <em>Chester</em>. The place
swarms with our men, and the buildings looking on the
Plaza are all occupied as quarters for our officers.
From the bullet-defaced belfry of the newly painted
cathedral blue-jackets looked down upon us, and from
every roof and every window faces of our own soldiers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
and officers were to be seen. We walked across to the
Municipal Palace, which is also used by us as a barracks.
The men of the <em>Utah</em> were answering the bugle-call to
muster for night duty. They were of the battalion landing
in small boats under heavy fire that first day; they
were saved by the cannon-fire from the ships. There
were many casualties among their ranks. The men look
happy, proud, and pleased, and in all the novel excitement
and pride of conquest. I went into the church,
where I also found some of our men stationed. Some one
had been shot and killed from behind the high altar,
two days ago. I fell on my knees, in the dimness, and
besought the God of armies.</p>

<p>As we walked along in the older part of the town, <i lang="fr">en
route</i> to the Naval Academy, there were piles of once
peaceful, love-fostering, green balconies heaped in the
streets. They will be used for camp-fires by our men.
Doors were broken in, houses empty. There was a great
deal of sniping done from the <i lang="es">azoteas</i> (roofs) those first
days, and it was necessary, in many cases, to batter down
the doors and go up and arrest the people caught <i lang="la">in
flagrante</i>, in that last retreat of the Latin-American.</p>

<p><i lang="es">Pulque</i><a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>-shops and <i lang="es">cantinas</i> of all descriptions were barricaded,
and, looking through the doors, we could see
heaps of broken glass, overturned tables and chairs. A
sour, acrid smell of various kinds of tropical “enliveners”
hung in the still, heavy air—mute witnesses of what had
been. We passed through several sinister-looking streets,
and I thought of “Mr. Dooley’s” expression, “The
trouble we would have if we would try to chase the Monroe
doctrine up every dark alley of Latin America.” The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
big, once-handsome Naval Academy was patrolled by
our men, its façade telling the tale of the taking of the
town only too well; windows destroyed by the <em>Chester’s</em>
guns, balconies hanging limply from their fastenings.
We looked through the big door facing the sea, but the
patrol said we could not enter without a permit. Every
conceivable disorder was evident—cadets’ uniforms lay
with sheets, pillows, books, broken furniture, heaps of
mortar, plaster. The boys made a heroic stand, and
many of them gave up their lives; but what could they
do when every window was a target for the unerring mark
of the <em>Chester’s</em> guns? Many a mother’s hope and pride
died that day for his country, before he had had a chance
to live for it. This is history at close range.</p>

<p>I had finally to hurry back, stopping, hot and tired,
for a few minutes at the Diligencias, where we had some
lukewarm ginger-ale; my sticky glass had a couple of
reminiscent lemon-seeds in it. It was getting dusk and
Rowan was afraid the sniping might begin. I got into
the <em>Minnesota’s</em> waiting boat, feeling unspeakably sad,
and was put out across the jeweled harbor—but what
jewels! Every one could deal a thousand deaths.</p>

<p>Nelson had a long talk with Admiral Fletcher....
On receipt of orders to prevent the delivery by the
<em>Ypiranga</em> of the arms and ammunition she was carrying
to the Mexican government and to seize the customs,
his duty was solely to carry out the commands of the
President in a manner as effective as possible, with as
little damage to ourselves as possible. This he did.</p>

<p>I think we have done a great wrong to these people;
instead of cutting out the sores with a clean, strong
knife of war and occupation, we have only put our
fingers in each festering wound and inflamed it further.
In Washington there is a word they don’t like, though it
has been written all over this port by every movement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>
of every war-ship and been thundered out by every
cannon—<span class="smcap">War</span>. What we are doing is war accompanied
by all the iniquitous results of half-measures, and in
Washington they call it “peaceful occupation.”</p>

<p>Now I must sleep. The horrors of San Juan Ulua (on
which our search-lights play continually) will haunt me,
I know. The stench of those manholes is rising to an
unanswering, starlit sky. May we soon deliver it
from itself!</p>


<h3><em>Saturday Morning.</em></h3>

<p>Captain Simpson came back from shore duty late last
night. He is so kind and solicitous for our comfort, that
I only hope we are not too greatly interfering with his.
He has had his men lodged in a theater, commandeered
for the purpose. He went to some barracks first, but
fortunately learned in time that there had been meningitis
there, and decamped even quicker than he went in.
Captain Niblack has taken his place.</p>

<p>The <em>Minnesota</em>, on which Admiral Fletcher was when
he went into Vera Cruz, is a ship not belonging to any
division down here, and is only temporarily in harbor.
So she is used for all sorts of disjointed, but important
work—distributing of supplies, communications of all
kinds. She is more than busy—a sort of clearing-house—during
what they call here “the hesitation war, one step
forward, one step back, hesitate, and then—side-step.”</p>

<p>The rescue-train goes out through our lines every day
under Lieutenant Fletcher, to meet any train possibly
arriving from the interior. And, oh, the odds and ends
of exasperated and ruined American humanity it
brings in!</p>

<h3><em>“Minnesota,” April 26th.</em></h3>

<p class="dropcap">When Nelson left, as you know, he turned our
affairs over to the British, an English-speaking,
friendly, great Power, which could and would help our
nationals in their desperate plight. Behold the result!
Last night we dined on the <em>Essex</em>, in our refugee clothes.
Sir Christopher, looking very handsome in cool, spotless
linen, met us at the gangway with real cordiality
and interest.</p>

<p>His first words after his welcome were, “I have good
news for you.”</p>

<p>“What is it?” we asked, eagerly. “We have heard
nothing.”</p>

<p>“Carden is going to arrange to get out a refugee-train
of several hundred Americans on Monday or Tuesday,
and I have this afternoon sent off Tweedie [commander
of the <em>Essex</em>] with two seven-foot marines and a native
guide to accompany the convoy down. He is to get up
by hook or crook. He will go by train, if there is a train,
by horse if there isn’t, and on foot, if he can’t get horses.”</p>

<p>You can imagine the love feast that followed as we
went down to dinner. We were proceeding with a very
nice piece of mutton (Admiral Badger had sent a fine,
juicy saddle over to Sir Christopher that morning) when
a telegram came—I think from Spring-Rice. Anyway,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>
the four Englishmen read it and looked rather grave.
After a pause Sir Christopher said, “They might as well
learn it from us.” What do you think that telegram
contained? The news that American interests had been
transferred from Sir Lionel’s hands into those of Cardoza,
the Brazilian minister! Of course I said to Sir Christopher,
“Our government very naturally wants to compliment
and sustain good relations with South America,
and this is an opportunity to emphasize the fact,” but
it was rather a damper to our love feast.</p>

<p>Well, we have taken our affairs and the lives of many
citizens out of the hands of a willing, powerful, and resourceful
nation and put them into the hands of a man
who, whatever Power he represents, has not the practical
means to carry out his kind desires or friendly intentions.
I doubt if Huerta knows him more than by
sight. Washington has made up its mind about
Carden and the English rôle in Mexico, and no deeds
of valor on the part of Carden will make any difference.
Washington won’t have him. Sir Christopher
Cradock, here in a big battle-ship in the harbor, is willing
and able to co-operate with Sir Lionel, the head of a
powerful legation in Mexico City, for the relief of our
nationals in sore plight and danger of life; but apparently
that has nothing to do with the case. Washington is relentless.</p>

<p>The <em>Essex</em> shows between eighty and ninety “wounds,”
the results of the fire from the Naval Academy on
Wednesday. Paymaster Kimber, whom they took me in
to see after dinner, was in bed, shot through both feet
and crippled for life. The ship was an “innocent bystander,”
with a vengeance. In Sir Christopher’s saloon,
or rather, Captain Watson’s saloon, were hung two slippers
(one of pink satin and the other of white) which had
been found at the Naval Academy after the fight—dumb<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>
witnesses of other things than war. The officers said
the Academy was a horrid sight. Those boys had taken
their mattresses from their beds, put them up at the
windows, and fired over the top; but when the fire
from the ships began these flimsy defenses were as
nothing. There were gallant deaths that day. May
their brave young souls rest in peace. I don’t want to
make invidious distinctions, but in Mexico the youngest
are often the brightest and noblest. Later there is
apt to be a discouraging amount of dross in the gold.</p>

<p>I keep thinking of Captain Tweedie, <i lang="fr">en route</i> to Mexico
City to help bring out American women and children.
When he gets there he will find that rescue isn’t any of
his business!</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon the <em>North Dakota</em> came in. We
saw her smoke far out at sea, and she was a great sight
as she dropped anchor outside the breakwater. I was
looking through the powerful glass on Captain Simpson’s
bridge. Her blue-jackets and marines were massed in
orderly lines, doubtless with their hearts beating high
at the idea of active service. Lieutenant Stevens, who
was slightly wounded in the chest on Wednesday, came
back to the ship yesterday. He is a young bridegroom
of last autumn and has been here since January. The
“cheerful, friendly” bullet is in his chest in a place
where he can always carry it. I understand that when
he was wounded he was on the outskirts of the town,
and that he and another wounded man, themselves on
the verge of collapse, carried an unconscious comrade
several kilometers to the hospital. But who shall record
<em>all</em> the gallant deeds of the 21st and 22d of April?<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span></p>

<p><em>“Minnesota,” April 26th. 3</em> <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span></p>

<p>I witnessed from the deck of our ship, an hour ago, the
dramatic end of the Tampico incident, and, doubtless,
the beginning of a much greater one—the raising of our
flag over the town of Vera Cruz, which was to-day put
under martial law. At 1.30 I went up on deck. The
bay was like a hot mirror, reflecting everything. Through
a glass I watched the preparations for the raising of the
flag on the building by the railroad station—an English
railway. “Who’s whose now,” came into my mind.</p>

<p>It was a busy scene on shore and land. Admiral
Badger passed over the shining water in his barge, a
beautiful little Herreschoff boat, shortly before two o’clock,
wearing side-arms. His staff was with him. Battalions
were landing from various ships and immense crowds
stood near the railroad station. There was an electric
something in the air. Captain Simpson and his officers,
of course, were all on deck, looking through their glasses,
and we were all breathing a little hard, wondering what
the foreign war-ships would do. Would they acknowledge
our salute? Exactly at two o’clock the flag
was raised, and immediately afterward the <em>Minnesota</em>
gave the famous twenty-one salutes to our own flag, refused
us at Tampico. The bay was ominously quiet after
the thunder of our cannon. I suppose the foreign
ships were all busy cabling home to their governments
for instructions. No man could venture to settle that
question on his own initiative. It was anti-climax with
a vengeance!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span></p>

<p>Is this to be the end of all that triangular work of
Nelson’s between Huerta, the Foreign Office, and Washington
during the two weeks elapsing since Colonel Hinojosa’s
taking of our blue-jackets out of their boat at
Tampico and our leaving the Embassy in Mexico City?</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>This morning I went ashore, accompanied by a young
officer, McNeir. We sauntered for an hour or so about
the town, which has decidedly pulled itself together.
Shops that were heaped with overturned furniture,
broken glass, and strewn with dirty papers and débris of
every description, visible through shattered windows and
broken doors two days ago, had been swept out and
were showing signs of normal occupation. New doors
were being made, and the little green balconies of peace
were being mended. Ensign McNeir suddenly found
that he had been spat upon. His broad chest was lavishly
embroidered in a design of tobacco-juice, doubtless
from an innocent-looking green balcony. He had blood
in his eye, and kept glancing about, hoping to find the
man that did it.</p>

<p>The Naval Academy was a horrid sight as we went in
from the sea-front. In the school-rooms books, maps,
globes, and desks were overthrown among masses of
mortar. One of the blackboards bore the now familiar
words in chalk, <i lang="es">Mueran los Gringos</i>. Great holes were in
floors, walls, and ceilings. When we went up-stairs the
devastation was even greater. Our men had fought in
the street, and the <em>Chester</em> and <em>Prairie</em> fired over their
heads just into the windows of the second floor, where
were the commandant’s quarters, and the large, airy dormitories.
The dormitories had been rifled before we put
a guard over the building, the lockers emptied of their
boyish treasures—knives, books, photographs; occasionally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>
a yellow or red artificial rose, a ribbon, or a bit of
lace testified to other gods than Mars.</p>

<p>The great floors were ankle-deep in a litter of uniforms,
shirts, collars, gloves, letters, brushes, combs, and
the like. They had been comfortable, airy quarters, and
I suppose now will make good barracks, or headquarters,
for <em>our</em> officers. Photographers were busy as we passed
through. In the two dormitories giving on the Plaza
at the back, away from the ships’ fire, the dying and
wounded had evidently been carried. Blood-soaked pillows,
mattresses, and sheets bore witness to their agonies.
Our men were busy everywhere in the building, sorting,
packing, and putting things in order. A town under
martial law seemed, this morning, an orderly affair
indeed.</p>

<p>I inclose Admiral Fletcher’s “Proclamation to the
Public of Vera Cruz,” also his order for martial law.
This proclamation will facilitate the functions of government.
Many difficulties were in the way of renewing the
regular civil and business activities of the town. There
is a clause in the Mexican constitution which makes it
high treason for any Mexican to hold employment under
a foreign flag during enemy occupation, and for once the
Mexicans seem to be living up to the constitution.</p>

<p>It is wonderful how our blue-jackets and marines have
been able to go into Vera Cruz and perform the complicated,
skilled labor necessary to the well-being of a
town. Everything, from the ice-plants and tramways
to the harbor lighthouse and post-office, has been put in
working order; they seem to step with equal facility
into one and every position requiring skilled labor.
They are a most resourceful set of men, these hatchet-faced,
fair-haired youths, the type standing out so distinctly
in that tropical setting. I was deeply impressed.
Six thousand of them are on land. On the trip down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>
our automobile clutch was damaged. Two blue-jackets
looked at it and, though neither had ever been in an
automobile before, they brought it back to the Terminal
station, several hours later, in perfect order, able and
longing to run it about town.</p>

<p>At noon yesterday thousands of arms were delivered
to the authorities—a hybrid collection of Mauser guns,
old duelling and muzzle-loading pistols. Relics of 1847
were also numerous. For several days there has been
little or no “sniping.” One man remarked, “Take it
from me, it’s a quiet old town. I walked ten blocks at
midnight, last night, without seeing a human being.”
I might also add that <em>I</em> know two methods of clearing
streets at night rivaling the curfew—snipers, <em>and</em> the
press-gang.</p>

</div>

<p>Yesterday at five o’clock we sent one thousand rations
into the starving fort of San Juan Ulua, and to-day our
flag flies high above it. All the political prisoners were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>
released. We could see from the deck of the <em>Minnesota</em>
two boat-loads of them coming across the shining water
and being landed at the Sanidad pier. After that, I
suppose, they swelled the ranks of the undesirable without
money, occupation, homes, or hopes.</p>

<p>I saw Mr. Hudson, yesterday, looking rather worn.
With groanings and travail unspeakable the <cite>Mexican
Herald</cite> is being published in Vera Cruz. He says they
have the greenest of green hands to set the type, and the
oftener it is corrected the worse the spelling gets, the
nights being one long hell. But as most of his readers
have a smattering of Spanish and English, with more
than a smattering of personal knowledge of the situation,
the <cite>Herald</cite> still is most acceptable as a “breakfast
food.”</p>

<p>The Inter-oceanic, the route to Mexico City over Puebla,
is being fast destroyed. Mustin in his hydroplane
can be seen flying over the bay, reconnoitering in that
direction. Puebla is the key to the taking of Mexico
City from Vera Cruz. It is always capitulating to somebody.
It will doubtless do so to us. In 1821 Iturbide
took it. In 1847 it was taken by Scott; in 1863 by the
French soldiers of Napoleon. In the battle of Puebla,
1867, there was a furious engagement between Don Porfirio
and the French. It is a beautiful old city—sometimes
called the “Rome” of Mexico, founded by Padre
Motolinía, situated about midway between the coast
and the Aztec city. It is crowded with churches and
convents, though many of these latter have been put
to other uses; however, the point now is when and how
our men will reach it. The blue skies and the deep
<i lang="es">barrancas</i> tell no tales.</p>


<h3><em>April 28th. Tuesday.</em></h3>

<p>Yesterday afternoon Major Butler came to see us.
He is in command at the “roundhouse” of Mr. Cummings’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>
telegraphic episode, and is decidedly downcast at
the idea that some peaceful agreement of a makeshift
order will be reached. He is like a hungry man who has
been given thin bread and butter when he wants beefsteak
and potatoes. He seemed, also, rather embarrassed
to be calling on us peacefully, on the <em>Minnesota’s</em> deck,
instead of rescuing us after a successful storming of Chapultepec,
or a siege at the Embassy.</p>

<p>Yesterday a notice was sent to hundreds of newspapers
at home (without my knowledge, of course) that I was
getting up a Red Cross nurse corps; but there is no need
for it. The <em>Solace</em> is not half full, the hospitals on shore
have plenty of room, and the ships’ doctors are not too
busy. I had said that if fighting continued I would return
from New York with the first corps of nurses that
came out. I have a feeling that instead of pushing on
to Panama <i lang="la">via</i> Mexico and Guatemala we are going to
make some patchwork with the A. B. C. combination.
It can be only a makeshift, at the best, and in any event
will be a reprieve for Huerta, though that is the last
thing our government intends. Its heart is given elsewhere.</p>

<p>Last night Admiral Cradock and Captain Watson came
to dinner. No mention was made by them of the raising
of the flag over Vera Cruz and of the salutes that had so
thrilled <em>us</em>. I imagine each admiral and captain in port
confined his activities during the afternoon to cabling to
his home government. The only thing Sir Christopher
said on the situation was to mildly inquire, “Do you
know yet whether you are at war or not?” Captain
Simpson had an excellent dinner, and we played bridge
afterward, the starry night concealing the fateful flag
above the English railroad terminal.</p>

<p>A belated <i lang="es">norte</i> is predicted, but my land eyes see no
sign of it. General Funston, of Aguinaldo and San<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>
Francisco earthquake fame, arrives this morning. The
army, I understand, has more suitable equipment and
paraphernalia for the work of occupation, or whatever
they call it; but I am unforgettably thrilled by the
majesty and might of our great navy.</p>


<h3><em>April 29th. Morning.</em></h3>

<p>The <i lang="es">norte</i> still threatens, but up to now, with falling
glass, there has been only a slight stirring of heavy, lifeless
air.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning we went on shore at ten, and found
the auto before the door of the Terminal station (otherwise
Admiral Fletcher’s headquarters). A French chauffeur,
risen up from somewhere, was sitting in it. No use
inquiring into the genesis of things these days. We
took Captain Simpson down to his old headquarters on
the <i lang="es">Paseo de los Cocos</i>. He wanted to see Captain
Niblack, who had replaced him in command. Then we
drove down through the town to the “roundhouse,”
bowing to friends and acquaintances on every side, and
feeling unwontedly comfortable and cool.</p>

<p>The roundhouse makes ideal quarters—a huge coolness,
with plenty of room for all the avocations of camp
life. After wading through a stretch of sand under a
blazing sky, we found Major Butler in his “headquarters”—a
freight-car—but with both opposite doors
rolled back, making the car cool and airy. Two of his
officers were with him. He is himself a man of exhaustless
nervous energy, and the A. B. C. combination
hangs like a sword over his head. He could go forward
and wipe up the coast to Panama, if he had the chance,
he and his set of dauntless men. A few disconsolate-looking
mules and horses were browsing in the dry, sandy
grass near by; they had been taken against payment.</p>

<p>“In the good old days in Nicaragua it was otherwise.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>
You <em>took</em> what you <em>needed</em>. This government running
things is too pious and honest to suit me,” was his
disgruntled observation when I asked if the steeds belonged
to him.</p>

<p>The order and tranquillity of this town is maintained
by force of arms and is complete. Since the desultory
shots heard Friday night, sniping being then in full force,
there has been silence along the dark waters; silence in
every <i lang="fr">cul-de-sac</i>, and silence on every roof.</p>

<p>At twelve we went back for Captain Simpson. We
had a glimpse of Captain Niblack and Captain Gibbons,
looking very big and effective in their khaki clothes.
We left N. at the Diligencias, under the arcades, where
people still drink lukewarm liquids, though Captain
Simpson said he had told them where they could get
cart-loads of ammonia for the repairing of the ice-plant.
At one o’clock I had a very pleasant <i lang="fr">tête-à-tête</i>
lunch with Captain Simpson. He was naval <i lang="fr">attaché</i>
in London before getting the <em>Minnesota</em>, and we found
ourselves, for once, talking of people and things far
removed from Vera Cruz. A note came for Nelson
from Captain Huse, saying the admiral wanted to
confer with him, and Captain Simpson sent a man
to find Nelson and deliver it. Afterward, Captain Moffett
of the <em>Chester</em> came on board. He has been a
friend of ours from the first, a very agreeable man, always
<i lang="fr">au courant</i> with events as they really are. We are
all hoping that the matter of the affairs of Americans
being taken out of the hands of Sir Lionel and given to
the Brazilians would not get into the newspapers. It
might lead to hard feeling between the nations and individuals
concerned. Captain Watson of the <em>Essex</em> then
appeared on board, with the Baron and Baroness von
Hiller, and we all went in his launch to the outer harbor,
which I had not yet seen—the view being completely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>
blocked by the <em>Condé</em>, which also hid the handsome <em>Essex</em>,
really very near us. Oh, the glory and majesty and potency
of the United States as there depicted! Great
dreadnoughts, destroyers, torpedo-boats, every imaginable
craft, nearly eighty of them—and for what? To
pry a sagacious and strong old Indian out of a place and
position that he has proved himself eminently well fitted
to fill. Captain Ballinger’s hydroplane, operated by
Mustin, was circling above the harbor, coming from time
to time to rest upon the water like some creature equally
at home in sky or sea.</p>

<p>In the evening we went to dine with the von Hillers,
aboard the <em>Ypiranga</em>. Admiral Cradock and Captain
Watson were also there. Captain Watson told me of the
return of Commander Tweedie, who had brought down
from Soledad in his private car two hundred and six
American men, women, and children, whom he had
found dumped on sand-dunes, and who had been without
food and without drink for twenty-four hours. I don’t
know the details, but I will ask Tweedie to lunch to-morrow.
This much I do know—that the English, whose
help we have refused, continue to display their strong
arms and kind hearts and have been angels of mercy
to our ruined and distracted countrymen.</p>

<p>After dinner we went up on deck, where Captain
Bonath of the <em>Ypiranga</em> joined the party. He was more
than polite to N. and myself, in a frozen way, but
the air was charged and tense, and the look of surprise,
indignation, and resentment not yet gone from his
face. In the course of the conversation it came out that
the Brazilian consul in Vera Cruz is a Mexican! There
was a scarcely perceptible shrug of the shoulders on the
part of the captain, and Captain Watson caught and
then avoided his eye. To all inquiries and innuendoes
we have only answered that, as Washington seemed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>
put some hope in the A. B. C. mediation affair, it was
thought best, at home, to pay Brazil the compliment of
putting our affairs in her hands. The fact is that all that
has been done at this special moment for our needy and
suffering ones has been accomplished by the long, strong
arm of England. Rowan, who was also at dinner, came
away with us and we walked along the pier through our
lines of sentinels pacing everywhere in the heavy darkness.
Away back in the country, on the dim distant sand-dunes
they are pacing too, alert, prepared for any surprise.</p>

<p>When we came out to the <em>Minnesota</em> not a breath was
stirring over the glassy water. Captain Simpson met us
at the gangway. I told him the air was a little tense on
shore, and added that I wanted to have Tweedie come
to see us to-morrow. So we arranged luncheon for to-day.
Captain Simpson remarked, with his usual broad
outlook, “The nations will have to work out things in
their own way; but we, the individuals, can always show
appreciation and courtesy.”</p>


<h3><em>“Minnesota,” April 30th. 8</em> <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span></h3>

<p>Yesterday, at 9.30, Captain Watson came to fetch me
to go to San Juan, dashing up to the ship in great style
in his motor-launch. Captain Simpson sent Lieutenant
Smyth, who was eager to see it, with us. We descended
the gangway in the blazing sun and got into the launch,
which, however, refused to move further. Finally, after
some time of hot rolling on the glassy water, we transferred
to one of the <em>Minnesota’s</em> boats, and in a few minutes
I found myself landing, after two months, at the
dreadful and picturesque fortress, under its new flag.
The old one, let us hope, will never again fly over hunger,
insanity, despair, and disease.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>We found Captain Chamberlain in his office. He is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>
strong, fine-looking young man. Indeed, our marines and
blue-jackets are a magnificent-looking set, hard as nails,
and endlessly eager. Captain Chamberlain was surrounded
by all the signs of “occupation,” in more senses
than one. Records, arms, ammunition, uniforms of the
“old régime” were piled about, waiting till the more
vital issues of flesh and blood, life and death, have been
disposed of. Captain Chamberlain was in New York
only a week ago, and now finds himself set to clean up,
in all ways, this human dumping-ground of centuries.
He detailed an orderly to accompany us, and we went
through a door on which the Spanish orders of the day
were still to be seen written in chalk.</p>

<p>We started through the big machine-house, which was
in excellent up-keep, so the officers said, full of all sorts
of valuable material, especially electrical. This brought
us out on the big central <i lang="es">patio</i>, where three groups of
fifty-one prisoners each sat blinking in the unaccustomed
light, and waiting to have straw hats portioned
out to them, temporarily shielding their heads from the
sun with rags, dishes, pans, baskets, and the like. An
extraordinary coughing, sneezing, spitting, and wheezing
was going on. Even in the hot sunshine these men were
pursued by the specters of bronchitis, pneumonia,
asthma, and kindred ills. We went into a dim dungeon,
just cleared of these one hundred and fifty-three men.
It seemed as if we must cut the air to get in, it was so
thick with human miasmas; and for hours afterward an
acrid, stifling something remained in my lungs, though
I kept inhaling deeply the sun-baked air. As my eyes
became accustomed to the darkness, I looked about; the
dripping walls were oozing with filth; there were wet
floors, and no furniture or sanitary fittings of any kind.
A few shallow saucepans, such as I had seen rations
poured into at my former visit, were lying about. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>
rest was empty, dark, reeking horror. But God knows
the place was abundantly hung and carpeted and furnished
with human misery, from the dull, physical ache
of the half-witted <i lang="es">peon</i>, to the exquisite torture of the
man of mind habituated to cleanliness and comfort.
What appalling dramas have there been enacted I dare
not think.</p>

<p>One was told me. A man, not long imprisoned,
accidentally found, in the darkness, a stick and a
thick, empty bottle. With the bottle he drove the
stick deep into the brain of a man, unknown to him, who
was dozing near him. When taken out to be shot he
was found to be of the educated class. He said, in unavailing
self-defense, that he had been crazed by the
darkness and the suffocating stench.</p>

<p>On coming out into the blessed air again, we examined
at rather close range these lines of men just readmitted
to the fellowship of sun and sky. They presented
a varied and disheartening study for the ethnologist—or
conqueror. There was every type, from
half-breed to full Indian; the majority of the faces
were pitted by smallpox. A few of the men had small,
treasured bundles, to which they clung, while others, except
for the rags that covered them, were as unfettered
by possessions as when they were born. Thick, matted,
black hair and irregular growths of stubby, Indian
beards gave their faces a savage aspect. At the end of
one of the lines were two very young boys, not more than
thirteen or fourteen, their faces still fresh and their eyes
bright. I wanted to ask why they were there, but their
line had received its hats, and they were marched out
through the portcullis to the beach.</p>

<p>Many of the inmates of San Juan were conscripts
awaiting the call to “fight” for their country; others
were civil delinquents, murderers, thieves. Most of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span>
poor brutes had a vacant look on their faces. The political
prisoners had already been freed. Two of the big
dungeons were still full. There were five or six hundred
in one space, pending the cleaning out of the empty ones,
when they were to be redistributed. Captain Chamberlain
was in the <i lang="es">patio</i>, trying to expedite matters, when
we came out of the first dungeon. I think he had some
sixty men to assist him, and was wrestling with book and
pencil, trying to make some sort of classification and
record. We walked over to another corner to inspect a
dungeon said to have chains on the walls and other
horrors still in place. Between the thick bars of one
where those sentenced to death for civil crimes were
kept peered a sinister face, pockmarked, loose of mouth,
and dull-eyed. I asked the owner of it what he had done.
“<i lang="es">Maté</i>” (“I killed”), he answered, briefly and hopelessly.
He knew he was to pay the penalty.</p>

<p>There has not yet been time for our men to investigate
fully the meager, inexact records of the prison. We went
through the <i lang="es">patio</i>, under the big portcullis, along the
way leading by the canals or moats to the graveyard
by the beach. This was speakingly empty. There were
only a few graves, and those seemed to be of officers or
commanders of the castle and members of their families
long since dead. With mortality so constantly at work,
and with no graves to be found, testimony, indeed, was
given by the sharks swimming in the waters. A simpler
process than burial was in practice: a hunting in the
darkness, a shoveling out of bodies, a throwing to the
sea—the ever-ready.</p>

<p>As we passed along one of the ledges we could hear
sounds of life, almost of animation, coming through the
loopholes that slanted in through the masonry—a yard
and a half deep by four inches wide. These four-inch
spaces were covered by a thick iron bar. When I had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span>
last passed there, a dead, despairing silence reigned.
Now, all knew that <em>something</em> had happened, that more
<em>was</em> to happen, and that good food was the order of the
day. Coming back, we met the second detachment of
fifty-one, being marched out to the sandy strip at the
ocean-end of the fortress. Many of them will be freed
to-day to join those other hundreds that I saw. They
will know again the responsibilities, as well as the joys of
freedom, but, alas, they will be of very little use to
the state or to themselves. We walked up the broad
stairs leading to the flat roofs covering the dungeons.
A squad of our men had established themselves on the
wide landing, with their folding-cots, rifles, and all the
paraphernalia of their business. Captain Watson said,
as we got upon the <i lang="es">azotea</i>, “The holes in the floor were
ordered cut by Madero when he came into power.” I
told him that I didn’t think so, they had seemed to me
very old; and when we examined them the raised edges
were found to be of an obsolete form and shape of brick,
and the iron barrings seemed to have centuries of rust
on them. Nothing was changed. Nothing had <em>ever</em> been
changed. It remained for a foreign hand to open the
doors.</p>

<p>The torpedo-house, which was near our landing,
seemed business-like, clean, and very expensive, even to
my inexpert eyes. Stores were being landed by one of
the <em>Minnesota’s</em> boats—great sides of beef, bread, coffee,
vegetables, sugar. I was so thankful to see them, and to
know that hunger no longer stalked right under our
bows.</p>

<p>I reached home in time for <em>two</em> baths and to change all
my clothing before one o’clock, when Commander
Tweedie arrived for lunch. He had a most interesting
tale to tell of his journey down from Mexico City, and
told it in the characteristic, deprecating way of an Englishman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span>
who has done something, but who neither wants
credit nor feels that he has done anything to deserve it.
He came back as far as Soledad in a special train, with
a guard of twenty-five of the famous Twenty-ninth.
At Soledad he saw a miserable, hungry, thirsty, worn-out
party of Americans, men, women, and children, from
Cordoba. Most of them had been in jail for eight days,
and then found themselves stranded at Soledad for
twenty-four hours, without food or drink, huddled up by
the railroad station. Tweedie is a man of resource.
Instead of getting back to Vera Cruz and reporting on
the condition, he made up his mind that he would take
the party on with him, or stay behind himself. After
some telegraphing to Maass, with whom he had, fortunately,
drunk a <i lang="es">copita</i> (oh, the power of the wicked <i lang="es">copita</i>!)
as he passed his garrison, he finally got permission to
start for Vera Cruz with the derelicts, under the fiction
of their being English.</p>

<p>They had to walk the twenty blazing kilometers from
Tejería, a sort of burning plowshare ordeal, one old
lady and various children being carried in blankets. He
gave them every available drop of liquid he had in his
car, and he said the way the children lapped up the
ginger-ale and lemonade was very amusing. Still under
the auspices of Carden, a train-load of five or six hundred
started, last night or this morning, for Coatzacoalcos.
Sir Lionel, fearing a panic, decided not to say, till he gets
off this last train-load, that our affairs are no longer in his
hands. I think magnanimity can scarcely go further;
my heart is full of gratitude for the inestimable services
the English have rendered my countrypeople.</p>

<p>At four o’clock I went on shore to see Admiral Fletcher.
Ensign Crisp (wearing side-arms) accompanied me. Captain
Simpson thinks it more suitable to send some one
with me, but never, in all her four hundred years or so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span>
of existence, has Vera Cruz been safer, more cheerful,
more prosperous, more hygienic. The <i lang="es">zopilotes</i> circling
the town must think mournfully of the days when everything
was thrown into the street for all that flies or
crawls to get fat and multiply on.</p>

<p>I found Admiral Fletcher in his headquarters at the
Terminal, serene and powerful. He said, “I go out to
the <em>Florida</em> to-morrow. I have finished my work here.
Things are ready to be turned over to General Funston.”
I told him not only of my admiration for his work during
these last days, and what it entailed, but that more than
all I admired his work of keeping peace in Mexican
waters for fourteen months. A dozen incidents could
have made for disturbance but for his calm judgment,
his shrewd head, and the big, very human heart beating
in his breast; and I said to him what I have repeated
on many occasions, that it is due to Huerta, to Admiral
Fletcher, and to Nelson that peace has been maintained
during these long, difficult months. It was destined for
an incident outside the radius of the power of these
three to bring about the military occupation.</p>

<p>We spoke a few words of the old Indian, still wrestling
on the heights. Admiral Fletcher ended by saying, in
his quiet, convincing manner, “Doubtless when I get to
Washington I will understand that point of view. Up
to now I know it only from this end.”</p>

<p>I told him how I hated half-measures; how they were
disastrous in every relation of life—family, civil, public,
and international—and never had that been proven more
clearly than here. Even he does not seem to know
whether we have brought all this tremendous machinery
to the shores of Mexico simply to retreat again, or
whether we are to go on. As I went away, I could but
tell him once more of my respect and affection for himself
and my admiration for his achievements. I passed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[337]</span>
out of the room, with tears in my eyes. I had seen a
great and good man at the end of a long and successful
task. Later, other honors will come to him. Probably
he will get the fleet. But never again will he, for fourteen
long months, keep peace, with his battle-ships filling
a rich and coveted harbor. When all is said and done,
that is his greatest work.</p>

<p class="chapblock">Our recall from Mexican soil—A historic dinner with General Funston—The
navy turns over the town of Vera Cruz to the army—The march
of the six thousand blue-jackets—Evening on the <em>Minnesota</em>.</p>


<h3><em>May 1st.</em></h3>

<p class="dropcap">Yesterday, April 30th, Admiral Fletcher turned
“La Villa Rica de la Vera Cruz” over to the army.
It was perfectly quiet, continuing to enjoy unknown
prosperity. But of that later. At eleven o’clock, as we
were about to go on shore, an envelope was brought to
N. On opening it he found it was his recall from Mexican
soil, and we forthwith departed for the shore to see
Admiral Fletcher. He was receiving visitors, for the
last time, at his headquarters, and N. was immediately
admitted. Admiral Badger passed through the
antechamber, in his strong, dynamic way, as I waited
with Captain Huse, whose face and personality are
graven on my memory as he appeared in my compartment
that afternoon at Tejería.</p>

<p>Soon I went into Admiral Fletcher’s room, a great,
square, high-ceilinged room, where he and Captain Huse
had slept and worked during all those strange days, with
another almost equally large, a sort of Neronian bathroom,
opening out of it. A breeze nearly always blows
in from the sea. N. was turning over the motor to
the navy, where it will be of great service. It was
a feat to get it down here with no further injury
than a damaged clutch, which the clever seamen put in
order. There was a good deal of coming and going at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span>
headquarters, so we soon left and went to call on General
Funston at General Maass’s old headquarters. It
ended by our remaining to dinner with General Funston—his
first dinner in General Maass’s home.</p>

<p>I suppose I am not only the only woman who has
had a meal there under two flags, but the only person.
I went up the broad stairs with Colonel Alvord, the
stairs I had last descended on General Maass’s arm.
When I got there General Funston was in the large front
room where the Maass family had lived and breathed
and had its being. After greeting him, my eye roved
over the room. On the table, with its white drawn-work
cloth, was the same centerpiece of white coral
(from which hung bits of bright green artificial moss) and
the large silver cup; there was the silent piano, with its
piles of worn music; the porcelain ship (sad augury),
filled with faded artificial roses; the bead curtains dividing
the big room in half; the rocking-chair of which the
family had been so proud; even the doily that came off
on my back! We went in almost immediately to the
large, bountifully spread table, where the food was
served in the Maass china. I, of course, sat on General
Funston’s right, and N. on his left. His fine, alert staff,
ready and anxious to take over the town and the country,
the hemisphere, or anything else, made up the party.
They were all very nice about my being there “to grace
their first meal.”</p>

<p>General Funston is small, quick, and vigorous. There
is a great atmosphere of competency about him, and he
is, they tell me, a magnificent field officer. He had been
to Mexico nineteen years before, thinking to invest
money in coffee; now in the turning wheel of life his reputation
is being invested in the situation which he is
more than equal to. They are all afraid that some hybrid
breed of “dove of peace”—“peace at any price” (or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span>
“preparedness for more kicks”—as some one gloomily
observed) will flap his wings over the land. The army is
ready, willing, and able to bring to a successful issue,
in the face of any difficulty, any task set it. I am
sure that the officers feel the cruelty of half-measures,
cruelty both to our own people and to Mexico; they
know war can’t be more disastrous than what we are
doing. The dinner of ham, with cream sauce, potatoes,
macaroni, beans, and pickles, came to an end all too soon.
Coffee and cigarettes were served as we still sat around
the big table. My eyes rested admiringly on those half-dozen
strong, competent men in their khaki suits. It is
the most becoming of all manly apparel—flannel shirt,
with low, pointed collar, trousers like riding-breeches,
leather leggings, cartridge-belts, and side-arms all in
one tone. They are going to pack the Maass relics
and turn them over to their owners. Admiral Fletcher
had sent a message to General Maass, promising to forward
all their effects. I must say I had a real conception
of “fortunes of war” when they hunted for butter-dishes
and coffee-cups in the Maasses’ gaudy china-closet.
They had only got into the house in the morning, and
had had no time for anything except the arrangements
for taking over the town.</p>

<p>General Funston said he had a little daughter, Elizabeth,
born to him the day he arrived in Vera Cruz.
He also told us he had been routed out of bed, one night,
by extras, saying “O’Shaughnessy Assassinated! <em>Prairie</em>
Sunk!” and he felt that the moment of departure
might, indeed, be near. He gave N. an historic pass
to go between the lines at any time, and we left soon
afterward, as it was nearing the hour for the officers to
go to the function on the Sanidad pier—“a little Funston,”
as Captain Huse called it. I shook hands with
them all and wished the general “Godspeed to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[341]</span>
heights.” Whatever is necessary, he and his strong,
faithful men will do. We walked through the hot, white
streets to the Plaza, and were soon overtaken by General
Funston and his chief of staff, riding in a disreputable
<i lang="es">coche</i> drawn by a pair of meager gray nags. I believe
the navy arrived on the scene in our smart auto. A few
minutes later I saw the general, in his khaki, standing by
Admiral Fletcher, who was in immaculate white on the
Sanidad pier.</p>

<p>Then began the wonderful march of six thousand blue-jackets
and marines back to their ships. The men had
had their precious baptism of fire. As ship’s battalion
after battalion passed, there was cheering, lifting of hats
to the colors, and many eyes were wet. The men
marched magnificently, with a great, ringing tread, and
made a splendid showing. If the old Indian on the hill
could have seen them he would have recognized all the
might and majesty of our land and the bootlessness of
any struggle. The passing of the troops and their
embarkment took exactly thirty-seven minutes. They
seemed to vanish away, to be dissolved into the sea,
their natural element. For a moment only the harbor
looked like some old print of Nelsonian embarkings—Trafalgar,
the Nile, Copenhagen, I know not what!
The navy flowed out and the army flowed in. There were
untold cinematograph and photograph men, and the
world will know the gallant sight. N. stood with
Admiral Fletcher and General Funston.</p>

<p>Sometimes, alone in Mexico City, with the whole responsibility
of the Embassy on his Shoulders, N.
would be discouraged, and I, too, fearful of the ultimate
end. Had I realized the might and magnificence of the
navy represented in the nearest harbor, ready and able
to back up our international undertakings and our national
dignity, I think I would never have had a moment’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span>
despondency. I said something of this to Captain
Simpson, and he answered, “Yes, but remember you
were in the woods.”</p>

<p>Admiral Busch took us back to the <em>Minnesota</em>, where
we arrived in time to see the returned men drawn up
on the decks to be inspected by Captain Simpson,
who gave them a few warm, understanding words of
commendation. Some were missing. Peace to them!</p>


<h3><em>Later.</em></h3>

<p>We went again on shore, leaving Nelson at the <i lang="es">Carlos
V.</i>, to return the call of the Spanish captain in Mexico
City. I was so tired out with the sun and the long day
that I stayed in the small boat. I simply had not the
nervous energy to climb the gangway and go on board,
though I would have liked to see the ship. After the
visit we went and sat under the <i lang="es">portales</i> of the Diligencias
for an hour or so, to watch the busy scene. The
ice-plant of the Diligencias was not yet in working order,
so the usual dirty, lukewarm drinks were being served to
disgusted patrons. In the Palacio Municipal, the Second
Infantry regiment was quartered, and under its <i lang="es">portales</i>
they had put up their cook-stoves and were preparing
their early evening meal, before going to their night-work
on the outposts. Several dozen fat, sleek, well-dressed
Mexicans were being shoved off at the point of
three or four bayonets. I asked Ensign McNeir why it
was, and he said:</p>

<p>“Oh, that is the bread-line. They can’t be bothered
with it now.” The “bread-line,” which at times
probably includes one-third of the population of Vera
Cruz, had evidently had good success at other points,
and had been enjoying a workless, well-fed day; for its
members had disposed themselves comfortably on bench
or curb of the Plaza, and listened to the strains of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[343]</span>
“Star-spangled Banner,” “Dixie,” and “The Dollar
Princess”—provided for their entertainment by the
thoughtful, lavish invaders. Even the little flower-girls
seemed to have on freshly starched petticoats; the
bright-eyed newsboys had clean shirts, and the swarming
bootblacks looked as spruce as their avocation permitted.
A sort of millennium has come to the city; and
money, too, will flow like water when pay-day comes
for the troops.</p>

<p>Richard Harding Davis came up to our table. His
quick eye misses nothing. <em>If</em> there is anything dull to
record of Vera Cruz, it won’t be dull when it gets to the
world through that vivid, beautiful prose of his. We
teased him about his hat, telling him there had been
many loud bands in town that day, marine bands, army
bands, and navy bands, but nothing quite as loud as his
blue-and-white polka-dot hat-band. We said he could
be spotted at any distance.</p>

<p>He answered, quite unabashed: “But isn’t recognition
what is wanted in Mexico?”</p>

<p>Jack London also came up to speak to us. Burnside,
his hair closely cropped and his heart as warm as ever,
sat with us during the many comings and goings of
others. Captain Lansing, a very smart-looking officer,
had recently been transferred from the pomp and circumstance
of Madrid, where he had been military <i lang="fr">attaché</i>, to
the jumping-off place of the world, Texas City. He said
that after a year in the dust or mud and general flatness
and staleness of that place, Vera Cruz seemed a gay
paradise. Lieutenant Newbold, from Washington, and
many others, were also presented. They all looked so
strong, so sound, so eager. I think eagerness is the quality
I shall best remember of the men at Vera Cruz.
Burnside walked back to the boat with us, the tropical
night falling in that five minutes’ walk. General Funston’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[344]</span>
first official orders were already up with the formal
notification of his authority:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom:-0.5em">Headquarters United States Expeditionary Forces.</p>

<p class="ir1" style="margin-bottom:-0.5em"><span class="smcap">Vera Cruz</span>, <em>April 30th, 1914</em>.</p>

<p class="center">GENERAL ORDER No. 1</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:-0.5em">The undersigned, pursuant to instructions from the President of the
United States, hereby assumes command of all the United States forces
in this city.</p>

<p class="ir0"><span class="smcap"><span style="padding-right:3em">Frederick Funston,</span></span><br>
Brig. Gen. U. S. Army Commanding.</p>
</div>

<p>Already in those short hours since the army “flowed”
in, the soldiers had installed themselves as though they
had been there forever. In the dusk we saw their tents
stretched, their bake-ovens up, and the smell of fresh
bread was mingled with the warm sea odors. It was
“efficiency” indeed.</p>


<h3><em>May 3d.</em></h3>

<p>This morning the news that Mr. Bryan will not permit
any fighting during the period of armistice and mediation
will dampen much of the eagerness I mentioned.</p>

<p>The full complement of the blue-jackets being again
on board, there is a lively sound of ship-cleaning going on.
Everything seemed immaculate before. We have been
so comfortable, so cool, so well looked after in every way
on this man-of-war. But I shall not soon forget the face
of the young officer just home from outpost duty who
discovered that my French maid was occupying his cabin!</p>

<p>Last night, as we sat talking on the deck, looking out
over the jeweled harbor, the gentle, peaceful bugle-call
to “taps” sounded suddenly from San Juan Ulua.
A big light hung over the entrance to Captain Chamberlain’s
quarters. It is balm on my soul that the pest-hole
of centuries is open to the sun and light, the bolts
hanging slack, and comparative peace and plenty everywhere.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[345]</span>
I say comparative peace, because those imprisoned
for murder and foul crimes are still to be dealt with.
When I first visited the prison under the Mexican flag
Captain McDougall and I asked the sentry who showed
us around if there had been many executions lately.</p>

<p>He answered, “Since <em>Thursday</em>” (this was Sunday)
“<em>only</em> by order of the colonel!” Whether this was true
or not I don’t know; but the guard gave it out with the
air of one making an ordinary statement. Captain
McDougall asked because, from the <em>Mayflower</em>, anchored
almost where we now are, he had heard many a shot at
night and in the early morning.</p>

<p>Immediately after dinner we had gone up on deck. A
delicious breeze was turning and twisting through the
soft, thick, tropical night. Every night a large screen is
put up on the after part of the ship, and the officers and
crew gather to watch the “movies,” seating themselves
without distinction of rank. The turrets are garlanded
with men; even the tops of the mast had their human decorations.
It was most refreshing, after the hot, historic
day, to sit quietly on the cool, dim deck and watch the old
tales of love, burglars, kidnapping, and kindred recitals
unroll themselves from the films. But it was more
beautiful later on, as we sat quietly on the deck in the
darkness, watching the wondrous scene about us. A
thousand lights were flashing across the water, catching
each dark ripple. The “city of ships,” as I call Vera
Cruz harbor, is constantly throwing its flash-lights, its
semaphores, its signalings of all kinds, and water and
sky reflect them a hundredfold.</p>

<p>Just after the peaceful sounding of “Taps” from the
fortress, Admiral Fletcher and Captain Huse came on
board to pay us a farewell visit. Admiral Fletcher’s
courtesy is always of the most delicate kind, coming
from the depths of his kind heart and his broad understanding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[346]</span>
of men and life. He and N. walked up and
down the deck for a while, planning about our getting
off. He intends that the <i lang="fr">chargé</i> shall depart from Mexican
waters with all fitting dignity. After a warm handclasp
he and Captain Huse went off over the summer
sea. Standing at the rail, we watched the barge disappear
into a wondrous marquetry design of darkness and light,
and knew that some things would never be again.</p>

<p>Later we got the inclosed radio from the <em>Arkansas</em>,
Admiral Badger’s flag-ship, to say the <em>Yankton</em> would be
put at our disposal on the morrow to take us to our
native shores, and so will the story end. I am homesick
for my beautiful plateau and the vibrant, multicolored life
I have been leading. <i lang="es">Adelante!</i> But I have little taste
for dinners, teas, and the usual <em>train-train</em>, though a few
expeditions to dress-makers and milliners will be profitable
to me as well as to them. As you know, I had no
time to have my personal things packed at the Embassy,
and what I did bring with me reposed for twenty-four
hours on the sand-dunes at Tejería, between the Mexican
lines and ours. My big yellow trunk is reported at the
Terminal station. What is left in it will be revealed
later. They may not call it war in Washington, but when
a woman loses her wardrobe she finds it difficult to call
it peace. N.’s famous collection of boots, forty or fifty
pairs, evidently left those sand-dunes on Aztec or mestizo
feet. My silver foxes and other furs I don’t worry about.
Under that blistering sky and on that hot, cutting sand
they could offer no temptations.</p>

<p>Joe Patterson has just been on board. He came down
with the army on the transport <em>Hancock</em>, <i lang="la">sui generis</i>, as
usual, his big body dressed in the loosest of tan coverings.
He is always electric and interesting, running with a
practised touch over many subjects. He said he wanted
not an interview with N. for his newspaper (which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[347]</span>
would finish N. “dead”), but to make some account
that would interest the public and not get him (N.) into
trouble. I shall be interested to see what he does. The
boresome news of the armistice has made him feel that
he wants to get back, and I dare say there will be many
a departure. Nelson will not allow himself to be interviewed
by a soul. It is impossible to please everybody,
but, oh, how easy it is to <em>dis</em>please everybody!</p>

<p class="chapblock">Homeward bound—Dead to the world in Sarah Bernhardt’s luxurious
cabin—Admiral Badger’s farewell—“The Father of Waters”—Mr.
Bryan’s earnest message—Arrival at Washington—<i lang="es">Adelante!</i></p>


<h3><em>Sunday, May 3d.</em></h3>

<p class="dropcap">I am writing in the depths of my cabin on the yacht
<em>Yankton</em>, which is carrying us to New Orleans as the
crow flies—a special trip for the purpose. In another
walk of life the <em>Yankton</em> was known as <em>La Cléopâtre</em>, and
belonged to Sarah Bernhardt. Now I, much the worse
for wear, occupy her cabin. She has never brought a
representative of the United States from the scene of
war before, but she is Admiral Badger’s special ship,
carries mails, special travelers, etc., and went around
the world with the fleet. The fleet met a typhoon, and
all were alarmed for the safety of the <em>Yankton</em>, which
emerged from the experience the least damaged of any ship.
I can testify that she rides the waves and that she even
jumps them. Admiral B. says that in harbor he uses
her chiefly for court-martials. Now I am here. Life is a
jumble, is it not?</p>

<p>At five o’clock, on Friday, May 1st, we said good-by
to dear Captain Simpson and all the luxurious hospitality
of the <em>Minnesota</em>, Commander Moody and the officers of
the day wishing us “Godspeed.” Just as we were leaving
Captain Simpson told us that he had been signaled
to send five hundred rations to San Juan Ulua. As we
pushed off across the water, accompanied by Ensign
Crisp, the boat officer of the day, great patches of khaki<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[349]</span>
colored the shores of the town. They were squads of
our men, their tents and paraphernalia, the color coming
out strong against Vera Cruz, which had an unwonted
grayish tone that afternoon. The <em>Yankton</em> was lying in
the outer harbor, surrounded by battle-ships, dreadnoughts,
and torpedo-boats—a mighty showing, a
circle of iron around that artery of beautiful, gasping
Mexico. It was about quarter before six when we reached
the <em>Yankton</em>. As I looked about I seemed to be in a
strange, gray city of battle-ships. Shortly afterward
Admiral Badger put out from his flag-ship, the <em>Arkansas</em>,
to say good-by to us. He came on board, greeting us
in his quick, masterful way. Such power has rarely
been seen under one man as that huge fleet represented
in Vera Cruz harbor, and the man commanding
it is fully equal to the task; he is alert, with piercing
blue eyes, very light hair gone white, and a clean, fresh
complexion—the typical mariner in a high place. I
think he feels entirely capable of going up and down
the coast and taking all and everything, even the
dreaded Tampico, with its manifest dangers of oil, fire,
disease, and all catastrophes that water can bring.
He spoke of the thirty thousand Americans who have
already appeared at our ports, driven from their comfortable
homes, now destitute, and who can’t return to
Mexico until we have made it possible.... I imagine
he strains at the leash. He loves it all, too, and it was
with a deep sigh that he said, “Unfortunately, in little
more than a month my time is up.” But all endings are
sad. Great bands of sunset red were suddenly stamped
across the sky as he went away, waving us more good
wishes.</p>

<p>Captain Joyce, who had gone into town to get us some
special kind of health certificate to obviate any quarantine
difficulties, came on board a little later, and soon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[350]</span>
after his return we were under way. The quick, tropical
night began to fall. What had been a circle of iron by
day was a huge girdle of light pressing against Mexico,
as potent under the stars as under the sun. My heart
was very sad.... I had witnessed a people’s agony and
I had said an irrevocable farewell to a fascinating phase
of my own life, and to a country whose charm I have
felt profoundly. Since then I have been dead to the
world, scribbling these words with limp fingers on a
damp bit of paper. This jaunty yacht is like a cockle-shell
on the shining waters. Admiral Fletcher and Admiral
Cradock sent wireless messages, which are lying
in a corner, crumpled up, like everything else.</p>

<p>I said to Elim, lying near by in his own little sackcloth
and ashes, “Yacht me no yachts,” and he answered,
“No yachts for me.” Later, recovered enough to make
a little joke, he said he was going to give me one for a
Christmas present.</p>

<p>I said, “I will sell it.”</p>

<p>He answered, “No, sink it. If we sell it dey’ll invite
us—dey always do.” He looked up later, with a moan,
to say, faintly, “I would rather have a big cramp dan
dis horriblest feeling in de world.”</p>

<p>This is, indeed, <i lang="fr">noblesse oblige</i>! I have suffered somewhat,
perhaps gloriously, for <i lang="es">la patria</i>, and I suppose I
ought to be willing to enact this final scene without bewailings;
but I have been buried to the world, and the
divine Sarah’s cabin is my coffin. If such discomfort
can exist where there is every modern convenience of
limitless ice, electric fans, the freshest and best of
food, what must have been the sufferings of people
in sailing-ships, delayed by northers or calms, with
never a cold drink? I envelop them all in boundless
sympathy, from Cortés to Madame Calderon de la
Barca.</p>

<h3><em>U. S. S. “Yankton.” May 4th. 3.30.</em></h3>

<p>Awhile ago I staggered up the hatchway, a pale
creature in damp white linen, to once more behold the
sky, after three cribbed and cabined days. A pilot’s
boat was rapidly approaching us on the nastiest, yellowest,
forlornest sea imaginable. I felt that I could no
longer endure the various sensations animating my body,
not even an instant longer. Then, suddenly, it seemed
we were in the southwest passage of the great delta,
out of that unspeakable roll, passing up the “Father of
Waters”—the abomination of desolation. Even the
gulls looked sad, and a bell-buoy was ringing a sort of
death-knell. Uniformly built houses were scattered at
intervals on the monotonous flat shores, where the only
thing that grows is tall, rank grass—whether out of
land or water it is impossible to say. These are the
dwellings of those lonely ones who work on the levees,
the wireless and coaling stations, dredging and “redeeming”
this seemingly ungrateful land, stretching out
through its flat, endless, desolate miles.</p>

<p>The water is yellower than the Tiber at its yellowest,
and no mantle of high and ancient civilization lends it an
enchantment. The pilot brought damp piles of papers
on board, but I can’t bear to read of Mexican matters.
Whether Carranza refuses flatly our request to discontinue
fighting during the mediation proceedings, or a
hasty New York editor calls Villa “the Stonewall Jackson
of Mexico,” it is only more of the same. My heart
and mind know it all too well.</p>

<p>I have a deep nostalgia for Mexico; even for its blood-red
color. Everything else the world can offer will seem
drab beside the memory of its strange magic.</p>

<p>A radio came from Mr. Bryan at six this morning
requesting N. to observe silence until he has conferred
in Washington. But N. had already made up his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[352]</span>
mind that <i lang="la">silentium</i> would be his sign and symbol. Unless
we get in at the merciful hour of dawn he will be
besieged by reporters. A word too much just now could
endlessly complicate matters for Washington.</p>

<p>We are slipping up broad, mournful, lake-like expanses
of water. From time to time a great split comes,
and it seems as if we had met another river, seeking another
outlet. More white and gray houses show themselves
against the tall, pale-green, persistent grasses and
the yellow of the river. They are lonely, isolated homes,
wherein each family earns its bread in the sweat of its
brow by some kind of attendance on the exacting “Father
of Waters”—mostly, trying to control him.</p>


<h3><em>6.45</em> <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span></h3>

<p>We have just slipped through quarantine like a fish.
Our own extraordinary orders and two or three telegrams
from Washington, with orders not to hold us up,
made it an easy matter. We saw the <em>Monterey</em>, which
had arrived in the morning, with six hundred and twenty-three
passengers aboard, moored at the dock. The
women and children were to sleep in screened tents on
land. Many of them were refugees from Mexico City
itself, and they cheered and waved, as we passed by,
and called “O’Shaughnessy! O’Shaughnessy!”</p>

<p>The refugees, according to the copy of the <cite>Picayune</cite>
the health officers left us, are loud in praise of Carden,
saying their escape is due to him and not to the State
Department, and giving incidental cheers for Roosevelt.
Dr. Corput is a martinet; but though he was hot and
decidedly wilted about the collar when his six-foot-two
person came into the saloon where we were dining, he
looked highly competent. It will be a bright microbe
that gets by him. He, with his yellow flag, is lord and
master of every craft and everything that breasts this
river.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[353]</span></p>

<p>The whole question of guarding the health of the
United States at this station is most interesting. It is
one of the largest in the world, but is taxed to its utmost
now by the thousands of refugees from Mexico, most of
them cursing the administration, as far as I can gather,
during the hundred and forty-five hours of travel since
leaving Mexico. The quarantine station itself, under
the red, late afternoon sun, looked a clean, attractive
village, supplemented by rows of tents. There are immense
sterilizers in which the whole equipment of a
ship can be put, huge inspection-rooms, great bathing-houses,
and a small herd of cattle. It is sufficient to
itself. Nothing can get at the inmates, nor can the inmates,
on the other hand, get at anything. I should
say that the wear and tear of existence would be
materially lessened during the one hundred and forty-five
hours. The great ships that pass up now are
laden with people who have been exposed to every
imaginable disease in the Mexican <i lang="fr">débâcle</i>. You remember
the small-pox outbreak in Rome, and how
<em>that</em> microbe was encouraged! Well, <i lang="fr">autre pays, autre
mœurs</i>. The Indian, however, thinks very little more
of having small-pox than we think of a bad cold in the
head.</p>


<h3><em>10</em> <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span></h3>

<p>We have been going up-stream very quietly, in this
dark, soft night, zigzagging up its mighty length to
avoid the current. Sometimes we were so near the
shores we could almost touch the ghostly willow-trees;
while mournful, suppressed night noises fell upon our
ears. The mosquitoes are about the size of flies—not
the singing variety, but the quiet, biteful kind. My
energies are needed to keep them off, so good night; all
is quiet along the Mississippi. We have ninety miles from
quarantine to New Orleans.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[354]</span></p>


<h3><em>May 5th.</em>
<em>In the train, going through Georgia and North Carolina.</em></h3>

<p>We got into New Orleans yesterday at 6.30 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>,
under a blazing sun. There were reporters and photographers
galore at the dock to meet us and the good ship
<em>Yankton</em>. They did not, however, get fat on what they
got from N., who refused to discuss the Mexican situation
in any way. But we <em>did</em> lend ourselves to the
camera. We were photographed on the ship, on the
blazing pier, in the noisy streets, near by, among a horror
of trucks and drays rattling over huge cobblestones,
and a few more terrors in ink will be broadcast. I
then went to the nearest good shop and got a black
taffeta gown (a Paquin model with low, white-tulle neck),
and began to feel quite human again. Then we motored
about for several hours with one of the officers, through
a city of beautiful homes, interesting old French and
foreign quarters, driving at last over a magnificent causeway.
On one side was a swamp filled by all sorts of
tropical vegetation, and, doubtless, inhabited by wet,
creeping things; on the other side, a broad canal. We
reached a place called West End, on Lake Pontchartrain,
where we lunched on shrimps, soft-shelled crabs,
and broiled chicken, quite up to the culinary reputation
of New Orleans. Afterward we went back to the boat
under a relentless afternoon sun and over more of those
unforgetable cobblestones.</p>

<p>I was completely done up. They were coaling as we
got back to the ship, but the sailors hastily shoveled a
way for me, and I threw myself on my bed in a state of
complete exhaustion. When I came on deck again at
5.30 the hideous coaling was done, the decks were washed,
and everything was in apple-pie order. Crowds were
again on the pier, and the photographers got in more work.
The golden figure of Cleopatra that decorates the prow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[355]</span>
was blood-red in the afternoon sun. At six we started
out with Captain Joyce, who had literally “stood on
the burning deck” all day, overseeing the coaling process.
We wanted to show him a little of the city in the sudden,
beautiful, balm-like gloaming. We stopped a moment
at the St. Charles, where I mailed my long <em>Yankton</em> letter,
and found it overflowing with Americans from
Mexico, with smiles or frowns upon their faces, according
as they were going to or leaving a bank account.
We then went to Antoine’s, which has been
celebrated for seventy-five years. There we had a perfect
dinner, preceded by a mysterious and delightful
appetizer, called a “pink angel,” or some such name, most
soothing in effect. (It proved to be made of the forbidden
absinthe.) Also there were oysters, roasted in
some dainty way, chicken okra, soft-shelled crabs again,
and frozen stuffed tomatoes.</p>

<p>New Orleans still retains a certain Old World flavor
and picturesqueness. One might even dream here.
Everything is not sacrificed at the altar of what is
called efficiency—that famous American word which
everywhere hits the returning native.</p>

<p>Some of the newspapers were quite amusing, and all
were complimentary. One congratulates N. on being
relieved “from the daily task of delivering ultimatums
to, and being hugged by, Huerta.” Others are very
anxious to know if “Vic Huerta” kissed and embraced
Mr. O’Shaughnessy on his departure. The <i lang="es">abrazo</i> is
certainly not in form or favor in the more reticent United
States of America.</p>


<h3><em>Richmond Hotel, Washington, D. C.</em></h3>

<p>We got in at seven o’clock, and, accompanied by the
usual press contingent, came to this hotel. The proprietor
had telegraphed to us to New Orleans, saying that
N. was the greatest diplomat of the century, American<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[356]</span>
patriot, and hero. We thought we’d try him, he sounded
so <em>very</em> pleasant, and we have found comfortable
quarters. Now, while waiting breakfast, ordered from
a Portuguese, I have these few minutes.</p>

<p>An amusing letter from Richard Harding Davis is
here, inclosing newspaper head-lines two and a half inches
high—“O’Shaughnessy Safe.” He adds, “Any man
who gets his name in type this size should be satisfied
that republics are not ungrateful!”</p>

<p>A pile of letters and notes awaits me; the telephone
has begun to ring. How will the Washington page
write itself? <i lang="es">Adelante!</i></p>

<em>Good Hope</em>, when it was sunk in the naval engagement off Coronel, Nov. 1,
1914. In the gathering darkness of the tropical ocean, the moon just rising
over a heavy sea, a great explosion was observed, according to Admiral
Count Spee’s report, between the funnels of the <em>Good Hope</em>, on which
numerous fires had already broken out. Shortly afterward she went down
in a great blaze, with her colors flying. God alone knows the many acts of
heroism there were performed. But I know that Sir Christopher Cradock,

<p><a id="Footnote_9" href="#FNanchor_9" class="label">[9]</a> This noble house has since passed into alien hands, and the great
library is scattered. Señora Garcia Pimentel was, fortunately, able to
send a few of the most valuable manuscripts to England—the Cortés letters,
the famous Motolinía manuscript, dedicated to the Conde de Benavente,
a first edition of Cervantes, the “Dialogos” of Salazar, and a volume
or two of Padre de la Vera Cruz and Padre Sahagun. She and
her unmarried daughter took these away, concealed under shawls, when
they were obliged to leave the house. There had been a sudden loud
knocking at the door in the dead of night, followed by the entry of Carranzista
officials. Madame Garcia Pimentel and her beautiful daughter were
alone in the house at the time; the father and sons, in danger of their
lives, had been secretly got to Vera Cruz, some time before.</p>

<p>The far-famed library of Casasus has also been scattered, its treasures
destroyed. Sometimes a priceless volume has been bought for a few

these treasures have forever disappeared.—E. O’S.</p>

exit from Mexico. With Zapata and Villa both threatening his
life, he lay concealed for some days in one of the foreign legations at
Mexico City. A safe-conduct from Gutierrez was finally procured, and
he left the city with Mr. Canova, one of our agents. Villa got news of
his departure and pursued him to Aguascalientes, Torreon, and Chihuahua,
finally coming up with him at Ortiz. Here, in the darkness, Don
Eduardo was able to escape from the train, wandering over that northern

September, 1914, as steward on a small ship. When he was received by
the Emperor on his appointment to Pekin, report has it that he said,

dash of Wainright and Castle and Wilkinson for the Customs-House;
Badger and Townsend pushing up the steel belfry stairs of the cathedral
in the hunt for snipers; Courts taking messages to the <em>Chester</em> through
the zone of fire. The enlisted men were magnificent. Chief Boatswain
McCloy, with a few men in small launches, steamed across the bay to
attract the fire of the sharpshooters so the <em>Prairie</em> could get the range.
